These materials reduce our reliance on virgin materials, which can carry geopolitical, environmental and ethical sourcing risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur product teams collaborate with suppliers to identify sustainable alternatives and ensure compliance with our restricted materials list and international substance regulations.\u201d\n\u201cOur Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) program includes annual supplier audits, focused on labor rights, health and safety, environmental performance and materials management. We assess suppliers' conformance to Dell\u2019s Code of Conduct and international standards.\u201d"
