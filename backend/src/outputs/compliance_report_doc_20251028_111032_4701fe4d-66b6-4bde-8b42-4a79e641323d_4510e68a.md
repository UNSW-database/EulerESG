## Detailed Analysis Results

### ❌ Not Disclosed

#### (1) Total water withdrawn (sasb_3_1_Total_water_withdrawn)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention water-related topics such as 'water stewardship' (Segment 2), 'factories with active water risk mitigation plans' (Segment 4), and 'water management' compliance (Segment 5), none of the retrieved content provides actual quantitative data or a clear disclosure for the metric 'Total water withdrawn' (SASB code sasb_3_1_Total_water_withdrawn). The references to water are contextual, focusing on risk management, compliance, and supply chain programs rather than reporting the total volume of water withdrawal. The retrieval results are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (mostly 0.429), indicating limited relevance. No semantic-level evidence confirms disclosure of the specific metric. Furthermore, no unit (e.g., cubic meters, liters) or time-series data related to total water withdrawal is present in any segment. As such, while water is acknowledged as a material issue, the specific SASB-mandated metric is not disclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P102_T000, P024_S001, P038_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose annual total water withdrawal data disaggregated by source (e.g., surface water, groundwater) and geographic location to meet SASB standards.
  - Include a dedicated section in future ESG reports for water resource management with quantified metrics, including total water withdrawn, consumed, and recycled.
  - Enhance disclosure quality by aligning water reporting with recognized frameworks such as GRI 303 and SASB A&D-ES-210a.1.
  - Improve retrieval accuracy by using structured metadata tagging for key ESG metrics to ensure higher match scores and better indexability.

#### (2) total water consumed (sasb_4_2_total_water_consumed)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention water-related topics such as 'water stewardship' (Segment 2), 'factories with active water risk mitigation plans' (Segment 4), and 'water management' compliance (Segment 5), none of them provide actual quantitative data for the metric 'total water consumed' (sasb_4_2_total_water_consumed). The retrieved segments were primarily identified through keyword matching (e.g., 'water', 'total', 'environmental') with moderate match scores (0.429–0.571), but these keywords appear in contexts related to environmental compliance, supply chain programs, or sustainability goals rather than direct disclosure of water consumption volume. There is no mention of units (e.g., cubic meters, million gallons) or time-series data corresponding to total water usage across operations. The absence of explicit numerical reporting on total water withdrawal or consumption indicates that the specific SASB metric has not been disclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P102_T000, P024_S001, P038_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose annual total water consumed in cubic meters or equivalent standard unit across all operations (direct and indirect), aligned with SASB and GRI standards.
  - Break down water consumption by region, facility type, or water-stressed areas to enhance transparency and stakeholder relevance.
  - Include a clear methodology for measuring and reporting total water consumption, including sources (surface, groundwater, municipal) and recirculated water.
  - Integrate water consumption data into future ESG reports with trend analysis (e.g., FY22–FY24) to demonstrate performance over time.

#### (3) percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress (sasb_5_3_percentage_of_each_in_regions_with_High_or_Ext)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no direct or indirect disclosure of the specific metric '(3) percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress' as defined by SASB. While several segments mention water stress (Segments 1 and 4), they do not provide the required percentage-based breakdown of operations or supply chain facilities located in high or extremely high baseline water stress regions. Segment 1 references '227 supplier factories in areas of water stress' but does not quantify this as a percentage of total facilities, nor does it specify alignment with baseline water stress thresholds (e.g., WRI Aqueduct or similar). Segment 4 reports absolute volumes of freshwater used in high water stress locales (39, 48, and 49 thousand m³ for FY22–FY24), but again, these are volume-based operational water use figures, not the percentage of facilities or assets in high-stress regions. The retrieval tags indicate keyword matches (e.g., 'high', 'water', 'stress', 'each'), but these appear to stem from partial keyword overlaps rather than semantic relevance to the target metric. The matched keywords have low to moderate match scores (0.400–0.500), suggesting weak retrieval confidence. No methodology or definition aligning with SASB’s geographic risk-based calculation is present. Therefore, while related water stewardship data exists, the specific SASB-mandated metric on percentage exposure in high-stress regions is not disclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P094_T000, P102_T000, P038_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose the total number of owned, operated, and key supplier facilities globally, and report the percentage located in regions classified as having High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress using a recognized external source such as WRI Aqueduct.
  - Align future disclosures with SASB Standard metrics by explicitly stating the geographic distribution of operations and supply chain assets relative to water stress levels.
  - Provide a clear methodology explaining how water stress regions are identified and how facility locations are mapped to those regions.
  - Include year-over-year percentage trends for facilities in high water stress regions to enable performance tracking.

#### Discussion of the integration of environmental considerations into strategic planning for data centre needs (sasb_6_Discussion_of_the_integration_of_environmental_con)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention integration into planning, infrastructure, or strategic processes (e.g., climate resilience integration into business planning in Segment 1), none specifically address the integration of environmental considerations into strategic planning for data centre needs. The keyword matches are weakly related (e.g., 'integration', 'planning', 'infrastructure', 'footprint') and primarily concern broader sustainability initiatives, product design, or asset recovery services rather than data centre-specific strategic planning. The retrieval types are all keyword-based with low to moderate match scores (0.200–0.400), and no semantic evidence supports a direct discussion of environmental integration in data centre strategy. Segment 5 touches on audit infrastructure and power efficiency but does not connect these practices to strategic planning. Overall, there is no clear, specific, or substantive disclosure addressing the metric's precise scope.
- **Evidence Segments**: P078_S009, P038_T000, P010_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly discuss how environmental factors (e.g., energy use, carbon emissions, water, resilience) are incorporated into the strategic planning of data centre operations and expansion.
  - Provide details on governance, decision-making frameworks, or risk assessments used to evaluate environmental impacts in data centre planning.
  - Include forward-looking plans or targets related to sustainable data centre development, especially in alignment with climate goals.

#### Number of users whose information is used for secondary purposes (sasb_8_Number_of_users_whose_information_is_used_for_seco)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no explicit disclosure of the metric 'Number of users whose information is used for secondary purposes' (sasb_8_Number_of_users_whose_information_is_used_for_seco). While several segments reference data privacy, use of personal data for legitimate business purposes, and customer control over personal data (Segments 1, 2, and 3), none provide quantitative or qualitative disclosures specifically addressing the number or proportion of users whose information is used for secondary purposes. The term 'secondary purposes'—which typically refers to uses beyond the primary reason for data collection such as marketing, analytics, or sharing with third parties—is not mentioned or defined in any segment. Although Segment 1 discusses Dell’s Trust goal and enhancements to the Privacy Center to improve user choice and control, it does not report metrics related to user data usage scope. Segments 4 and 5 contain performance tables with numerical data, but these pertain to waste management and digital inclusion, respectively, and are unrelated to data usage practices. All retrieval results were based on keyword matching with relatively low match scores (0.300–0.400), indicating weak relevance between the search query and the content. No semantic matches were retrieved, further suggesting a lack of direct contextual alignment. Therefore, despite some tangential discussion of data privacy policies and principles, there is no substantive disclosure of the specified metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P011_S020, P071_S002
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly define what constitutes 'secondary purposes' in the context of data usage to ensure clarity and consistency in reporting.
  - Implement tracking and reporting mechanisms for the number of users whose personal data is used beyond primary collection purposes, aligned with SASB standards.
  - Enhance transparency by including this metric in future ESG reports with year-over-year data, ideally within a dedicated data privacy or responsible data use section.
  - Consider integrating user consent and opt-out rates related to secondary data use to provide deeper insight into user autonomy and privacy practices.

#### Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with user privacy (sasb_9_Total_amount_of_monetary_losses_as_a_result_of_leg)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention privacy, legal compliance, and data protection (e.g., Global Data Privacy Policy, Privacy Center expansion, ethics and legal teams), none of the retrieved content explicitly discloses or quantifies any monetary losses resulting from legal proceedings related to user privacy. The keyword matches (e.g., 'legal', 'privacy', 'user', 'result', 'total') appear to be surface-level and contextually incidental, likely due to low match scores (all at 0.200) and keyword-based retrieval rather than semantic relevance. There is no indication of litigation outcomes, financial penalties, settlements, or regulatory fines tied to user privacy violations. The content focuses on proactive privacy measures, governance frameworks, and trust initiatives rather than retrospective disclosure of financial impacts from legal actions.
- **Evidence Segments**: P045_S019, P067_T000, P071_S002
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report whether any legal proceedings related to user privacy occurred during the reporting period.
  - Disclose the total amount of monetary losses (if any) from settlements, fines, or judgments associated with user privacy violations in alignment with SASB standards.
  - Improve structured reporting by including a dedicated section for legal and financial risks related to data privacy, even if the disclosed value is zero.
  - Enhance document indexing and tagging to ensure high-relevance semantic retrieval for ESG metrics, particularly for financially material topics like regulatory risk.

#### (1) Number of law enforcement requests for user information (sasb_10_1_Number_of_law_enforcement_requests_for_user_in)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments discuss privacy, data handling, user rights, and trust—particularly in relation to customer control over personal data, internal policies, and the Privacy Center—there is no explicit mention of law enforcement requests for user information. The metric specifically requires disclosure of the number or volume of such requests, which is absent across all retrieved content. While Segments 3 and 5 reference data subject rights requests and internal data governance, these pertain to individual privacy rights (e.g., access, deletion), not government or law enforcement demands. The tag information indicates keyword matches around 'privacy,' 'data,' 'information,' and 'requests,' but these are contextually tied to user-initiated actions or general policy frameworks rather than legal disclosures. No quantitative data or qualitative descriptions related to law enforcement inquiries are provided. Therefore, despite relevant thematic alignment with privacy and data governance, the specific metric remains undisclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P071_S009, P071_S011
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose the number of law enforcement requests received during the reporting period, segmented by region or jurisdiction if applicable.
  - Include a dedicated section on government data requests in future ESG reports, aligning with industry standards such as those from SASB or GRI.
  - Clarify Dell’s review and compliance process for law enforcement requests, including legal basis, oversight mechanisms, and user notification practices where permissible.

#### (2) number of users whose information was requested (sasb_11_2_number_of_users_whose_information_was_requeste)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments reference privacy, data handling, and related policies—such as the Global Data Privacy Policy, Privacy by Design Standard, and customer access to privacy information—there is no explicit mention or disclosure of the specific metric 'number of users whose information was requested.' The retrieved segments were primarily identified through keyword matching (e.g., 'privacy,' 'data,' 'information,' 'number') with moderate match scores (0.333–0.444), but none contain quantitative data or narrative discussion directly tied to government or third-party requests for user information. The Trust section (referenced in Segment 1 and Segment 2) discusses broader trust initiatives, including authentication and customer control over personal data, but does not report metrics on user data requests. There is no evidence of disclosure regarding the frequency, scope, or volume of such requests, which is typically expected for this SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P056_T000, P071_S002
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose the number of users whose information was requested by governments or third parties during the reporting period, in alignment with SASB standards.
  - Include a dedicated subsection in the Trust or Privacy section addressing transparency around data requests, including definitions, scope, and response protocols.
  - Enhance disclosure quality by providing trend data, geographic breakdowns, and legal bases for such requests.
  - Improve keyword and semantic traceability by tagging relevant content with metric-specific identifiers (e.g., 'user data requests', 'government disclosures') to ensure retrievability in future analyses.

####  (3) percentage resulting in disclosure (sasb_12__3_percentage_resulting_in_disclosure)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'sasb_12__3_percentage_resulting_in_disclosure' pertains to the percentage of data incidents or requests that result in disclosure, likely in the context of data privacy and transparency practices. While several retrieved segments discuss data privacy, customer control over personal data, and trust (particularly in Segment 1 and 2), none provide any quantitative percentage or specific metric related to disclosures resulting from data-related events, requests, or incidents. The mention of the Privacy Center's expansion and SBOM generation does not equate to reporting on the proportion of cases resulting in disclosure. All segments were retrieved via keyword matching with a moderate score (0.286), but the content is only tangentially related—focusing on general privacy initiatives rather than the specific performance metric in question. There is no direct or indirect reference to a calculated percentage or outcome rate tied to disclosure decisions. Therefore, despite relevant thematic context, there is no actual disclosure of the required metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P010_T000, P010_S013, P011_S020
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the percentage of data access requests, breaches, or compliance inquiries that resulted in data disclosure during the reporting period.
  - Define the scope and methodology for calculating the 'percentage resulting in disclosure' to align with SASB standards for comparability and transparency.
  - Include this metric in future ESG reports under the Data Privacy & Security section with clear quantification and year-over-year tracking.

#### List of countries where core products or services are subject to government-required monitoring, blocking, content filtering, or censoring (sasb_13_List_of_countries_where_core_products_or_services_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no evidence that the company discloses the list of countries where its core products or services are subject to government-required monitoring, blocking, content filtering, or censoring. While multiple segments mention 'products' and 'where' (triggering keyword-based retrieval with low match scores of 0.200), these references are contextually related to environmental performance (e.g., Scope 3 emissions, product energy use, EPEAT registration) and trust governance (e.g., SBOMs, privacy controls), not to governmental censorship or content control requirements. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with uniformly low match scores, indicating weak relevance to the actual intent of the metric. No semantic connections to censorship, regulatory compliance by country, or restrictions on product functionality due to government mandates are present in the text. Therefore, despite tangential mentions of products and geographic scope (e.g., Privacy Center available in 74 locations), there is no direct or indirect disclosure of the specific countries where core offerings are subject to state-imposed digital restrictions.
- **Evidence Segments**: P010_T000, P017_T001, P018_S013
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Publicly disclose a comprehensive list of countries where Dell's core products or services are required by law to undergo government monitoring, content filtering, or censorship.
  - Enhance transparency by explaining how the company responds to government requests for data access or service modification, aligned with frameworks like the Global Network Initiative.
  - Include this disclosure in future ESG reports with clear categorization by country, product line, and type of regulatory requirement (e.g., blocking, filtering, surveillance).

#### (1) Number of data breaches (sasb_14_1_Number_of_data_breaches)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention keywords related to 'data', 'security', and 'privacy'—such as in references to data breaches, trust, and security practices—there is no explicit disclosure of the metric 'Number of data breaches' (sasb_14_1_Number_of_data_breaches). The retrieved segments are primarily keyword-based matches with moderate to low match scores (0.500–0.750), and none provide quantitative or qualitative information about actual data breach incidents during the reporting period. Segment 1 discusses trust and security initiatives like Zero Trust architecture and SBOM transparency but does not report any breach statistics. Other segments reference data privacy and security as thematic areas without disclosing incident metrics. There is no semantic indication of breach frequency, scope, or impact. Therefore, while the topic is contextually relevant, there is no substantive disclosure of the specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P006_T000, P011_S020
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the number of data breaches experienced during the fiscal year, aligned with SASB standards for comparability and completeness.
  - Include contextual details such as the nature, impact, and response to any reported breaches to enhance transparency and stakeholder trust.
  - Strengthen disclosure mechanisms by integrating specific ESG metrics into dedicated sections of the ESG report, ensuring they are easily identifiable and retrievable via both keyword and semantic search methods.

#### (2) percentage that are personal data breaches (sasb_15_2_percentage_that_are_personal_data_breaches)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments reference related concepts such as 'personal data', 'data security', 'privacy', and 'trust', none of the retrieved content directly discloses the specific metric 'percentage that are personal data breaches' (sasb_15_2_percentage_that_are_personal_data_breaches). The segments discuss qualitative progress on privacy controls, customer choice over personal data, and broader data protection initiatives (e.g., Privacy Center expansion, SBOMs, Zero Trust), but no quantitative data or explicit mention of personal data breach percentages is provided. The matching keywords (e.g., 'personal', 'data', 'percentage', 'that') appear to have triggered retrieval based on thematic proximity rather than actual metric reporting. Furthermore, the highest match score (0.667) across keyword-based retrievals indicates only moderate relevance, and no semantic evidence confirms disclosure of the exact KPI. The methodology for measuring trust is explicitly stated as still in development, reinforcing the absence of standardized metrics like personal data breach rates.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P091_T000, P105_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the percentage of personal data breaches annually, aligned with SASB standards, to ensure compliance and transparency.
  - Strengthen disclosure frameworks by defining clear metrics and methodologies for tracking and reporting data breach incidents involving personal data.
  - Improve tagging and internal documentation to link strategic goals (e.g., customer trust) with operational risk metrics such as breach rates, ensuring downstream visibility in ESG reporting.

#### (3) number of users affected (sasb_16_3_number_of_users_affected)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tags, there is no explicit or implicit disclosure of the metric 'number of users affected' (sasb_16_3_number_of_users_affected). While several segments mention related concepts such as data privacy, security, trust, and user control—particularly in the context of authentication, software bills of materials (SBOM), and customer trust—none provide any quantitative or qualitative information about the number of users impacted by security incidents, data breaches, or privacy violations. The highest-scoring segment (Segment 1, Match Score: 0.800) discusses trust initiatives, password-less authentication, and SBOM transparency but does not report any incident-related user impact metrics. Other segments reference general business operations, R&D investment, global presence, and energy use, which are unrelated to the specific metric. The keyword matches on terms like 'number', 'users', 'data', and 'security' appear to have triggered retrieval due to thematic relevance rather than actual metric reporting. No numerical values or event descriptions tied to affected users are present across the corpus.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P006_T000, P011_S020
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the number of users affected by data breaches, security incidents, or privacy violations in alignment with SASB standards.
  - Include disclosures in future ESG reports under relevant sections such as 'Security', 'Privacy', or 'Incident Response' with clear metrics and time-bound context.
  - Enhance metadata tagging and internal classification to ensure that disclosures related to user impact are accurately indexed and retrievable for compliance assessments.

#### Percentage of employees that require a work visa (sasb_18_Percentage_of_employees_that_require_a_work_visa)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no mention of the specific metric 'Percentage of employees that require a work visa' (SASB code: sasb_18_Percentage_of_employees_that_require_a_work_visa) in any of the provided content. While multiple segments discuss workforce diversity, inclusion goals, and related percentages—such as gender and racial/ethnic representation in the workforce and leadership roles—none refer to immigration status, visa requirements, or work authorization metrics. The keyword matches (e.g., 'percentage', 'that', 'global', 'work') appear to be generic and contextually unrelated to the target metric, and the retrieval types are primarily keyword-based with moderate scores (0.400–0.500), suggesting weak relevance. No semantic indication or indirect reference to employee visa status or work permit requirements is present. Therefore, the disclosure for this specific SASB metric is absent.
- **Evidence Segments**: P047_T000, P104_T000, P030_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Include data on the percentage of employees requiring work visas in future ESG reports to align with SASB Standard HR-HU-260a.3, which emphasizes workforce mobility and immigration-related risks.
  - Enhance metadata tagging and retrieval systems to ensure that disclosures related to global workforce compliance, including visa and work permit metrics, are accurately indexed and retrievable via both keyword and semantic search methods.
  - Consider adding this metric under the 'Inclusive Workforce' or 'Workforce Accountability' sections, where other demographic and employment-status-related metrics are reported, to maintain thematic consistency.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (a) executive management (sasb_21_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While multiple segments reference diversity, workforce representation, and related goals (particularly for women and U.S. racial/ethnic groups), none specifically disclose the percentage of two diversity group representations within executive management, which is the core requirement of the SASB metric sasb_21_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f. Segment 1 provides data on global and U.S. people leaders identifying as women and as Black/African American or Hispanic/Latino, but does not explicitly define 'people leaders' as 'executive management,' nor does it confirm that both metrics are reported in the context of executive roles with sufficient clarity. Additionally, the data is aggregated without clear delineation between general leadership and executive-level positions. The retrieval types are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (up to 0.600), indicating limited contextual relevance. No semantic matches were found, suggesting a lack of direct conceptual alignment. Therefore, despite relevant thematic content, the specific metric for executive management remains undisclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P047_T000, P047_S006, P108_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly define 'people leaders' in relation to 'executive management' to ensure alignment with SASB definitions.
  - Report diversity metrics specifically for the executive management tier, covering at least two defined diversity groups (e.g., gender and race/ethnicity).
  - Include a dedicated table or section that directly addresses SASB TC-HW-330a and TC-SI-330a.3 metrics with clear labeling of executive-level representation.
  - Enhance disclosure quality by using semantic tagging and structured data presentation aligned with ESG reporting frameworks.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (b) non-executive management (sasb_22_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While several segments mention diversity-related metrics such as gender and racial/ethnic representation in the workforce and leadership, none specifically disclose the percentage of two diversity groups within non-executive management. Segment 1 provides data on women and U.S. underrepresented racial/ethnic groups (Black/African American or Hispanic/Latino) in the global workforce and among people leaders, but 'people leaders' are not explicitly defined as non-executive management. Segment 4 breaks down U.S. race/ethnicity representation by role type (e.g., non-technical), but does not isolate non-executive management roles or combine two diversity groups for this specific cohort. Segment 3 references SASB metrics related to workforce diversity (SASB TC-HW-330a, SASB TC-SI-330a.3), suggesting alignment intent, but does not present the actual disaggregated data for non-executive management. No segment reports a combined metric for two diversity groups (e.g., gender and race) specifically for non-executive managers. The retrieved content is primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (up to 0.600), but lacks semantic precision for this specific metric. Therefore, while contextual information on diversity is present, the exact metric required is not disclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P047_T000, P047_S006, P108_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly define 'people leaders' in disclosures to clarify whether they include non-executive management roles.
  - Report diversity metrics segmented by management level, including a distinct category for non-executive management.
  - Combine intersectional diversity data (e.g., gender and race) for relevant workforce segments to meet SASB metric requirements.
  - Directly label and publish the 'Percentage of 2 diversity group representation for non-executive management' with clear scope and definitions.

#### Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with anti-competitive behaviour regulations (sasb_25_Total_amount_of_monetary_losses_as_a_result_of_leg)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no direct or indirect mention of the metric 'Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with anti-competitive behaviour regulations'. Although several segments reference related keywords such as 'regulations', 'result', and 'total', these matches are contextually unrelated to financial losses from legal actions tied to anti-competitive behavior. Segment 1 discusses compliance percentages in ethics categories including 'Fair business, advertising and competition', but does not report any monetary penalties or legal proceedings. The other segments mention results, regulations, or totals in entirely different contexts—such as product quality, carbon emissions policy research, and digital health enrollment—none of which pertain to litigation outcomes or financial losses due to anti-competitive practices. All retrieval instances were keyword-based with low match scores (0.200–0.300), indicating weak relevance. No semantic-level contextual support exists for disclosure of this specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P096_T001, P011_S016, P012_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose any monetary losses arising from legal proceedings related to anti-competitive behavior in future ESG reports to align with SASB standards.
  - Improve metadata tagging and indexing of financial compliance data to enhance retrieval accuracy for regulatory-related metrics.
  - Include a dedicated section on legal and regulatory risks, particularly covering antitrust and competition law compliance, with quantitative disclosures where applicable.

#### Number of (1) performance issues  (sasb_26_Number_of_1_performance_issues_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no direct or indirect disclosure of the metric 'Number of (1) performance issues'. Although several segments mention related keywords such as 'performance', 'number', and 'issues', these references are contextually unrelated to the specific ESG metric in question. Segment 1 includes a table with various governance-related KPIs but does not list any data on performance issues. Segments 3 and 4 report numerical performance metrics (e.g., training hours, volunteer hours, people reached), but these pertain to social impact and giving programs, not performance issues. Segment 2 discusses sustainability risks and issue mitigation in the supply chain audit program, but no quantified data on the number of performance issues is provided. The retrieval types are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (up to 0.556), indicating weak semantic relevance. No segment contains explicit numerical reporting, definition, or contextual linkage to 'performance issues' as an ESG compliance metric. Therefore, the disclosure is absent.
- **Evidence Segments**: P107_T000, P059_S008, P091_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly define and report the 'Number of performance issues' metric in future ESG reports, particularly within governance or operational risk sections.
  - Enhance metadata tagging and indexing to improve semantic retrieval accuracy for ESG metrics, ensuring relevant content is captured during automated audits.
  - Align disclosures with SASB standards by including performance issue counts related to environmental, social, or governance incidents, especially those impacting stakeholders or regulatory compliance.

#### (2) service disruptions (sasb_27_2_service_disruptions)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments predominantly reference various services offered by Dell, such as Asset Recovery Services, Data Sanitization, Technology Rotation, and PC-as-a-Service (APEX), which emphasize sustainability, security, and responsible end-of-life management of IT equipment. While these services are described in detail, there is no mention of service disruptions—defined as unplanned outages, interruptions, or failures in service delivery that may affect customers or operations. The keyword matches (e.g., 'service', 'technology') appear to stem from the general use of the term 'service' in describing business offerings rather than reporting on service continuity or disruption metrics. Furthermore, none of the tables or descriptive text include data on frequency, duration, causes, or impacts of service disruptions, nor any performance indicators related to service reliability or uptime. The retrieval type for all segments is 'keyword' with a moderate match score (0.429), indicating weak contextual relevance despite surface-level keyword overlap. There is no evidence of structured or narrative disclosure addressing the specific ESG metric 'service disruptions'.
- **Evidence Segments**: P017_T001, P037_S004, P038_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report on service disruption incidents, including number of events, downtime duration, root causes, and affected customer segments.
  - Introduce key performance indicators (KPIs) related to service availability and reliability, especially for critical offerings like APEX or cloud-based services.
  - Enhance disclosure by aligning with SASB standards for the sasb_27_2_service_disruptions metric, which typically calls for quantified data on material service interruptions.
  - Include information on mitigation strategies, incident response protocols, and improvements in service resilience over time.

#### (3) total customer downtime (sasb_28_3_total_customer_downtime)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no mention of the specific metric 'total customer downtime' (sasb_28_3_total_customer_downtime) in any of the provided content. Although several segments contain keywords such as 'customer', 'total', and 'technology'—which contributed to moderate match scores (0.444)—the retrieval was based on keyword matching rather than semantic relevance to the target metric. The tables discuss topics including sustainable materials, product collection, employee volunteerism, ESG governance, and trust initiatives, but none report performance data related to customer system or service downtime. Furthermore, the context of 'total' in the segments refers to metrics like total contributions, total volunteer hours, or total incidents—not operational service availability or downtime. Given that the SASB metric sasb_28_3_total_customer_downtime specifically requires disclosure of quantified customer downtime (likely in hours or minutes), and no such data or even references to service interruptions appear, the metric has not been disclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P084_T000, P092_T000, P107_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly define and report the 'total customer downtime' metric in future sustainability reports, particularly within sections addressing product reliability, service continuity, or customer trust.
  - Enhance semantic tagging and indexing of ESG reports to ensure critical SASB metrics are captured and retrievable based on both keyword and contextual relevance.
  - Align disclosures with SASB standards for the Technology & Communications sector, specifically Standard TC-HW-280a.3, which calls for disclosure of total customer downtime to reflect service reliability and operational resilience.

#### Description of business continuity risks related to disruptions of operations (sasb_29_Description_of_business_continuity_risks_related_t)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several retrieved segments mention terms related to the metric—such as 'business', 'operations', and 'risks'—the content does not provide a substantive description of business continuity risks associated with operational disruptions. The highest matching score (0.400) comes from Segment 1 and Segment 2, both retrieved via keyword matching, but their relevance is superficial: Segment 1 focuses on greenhouse gas emissions data and climate action goals without addressing operational disruption or business continuity planning; Segment 2 defines climate-related risks in general terms (e.g., physical and transitional risks), but does not link them to business continuity or operational resilience. Other segments reference business operations in the context of performance, technology, or energy use, which are tangential at best. None of the segments describe risk management strategies, contingency plans, or specific threats to operational continuity (e.g., natural disasters, cyberattacks, supply chain failures). The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based, and the match scores are low to moderate, indicating weak semantic alignment with the target metric. Overall, there is no direct or indirect evidence that the company has disclosed information specifically addressing business continuity risks related to disruptions of operations.
- **Evidence Segments**: P081_T000, P111_S013, P011_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a dedicated section describing key business continuity risks, including those arising from climate change, cyber threats, supply chain interruptions, or geopolitical events.
  - Explain how the organization identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks to operational continuity, including references to formal business continuity management systems (BCMS) or crisis response frameworks.
  - Include examples of past disruptions and how they were managed, if applicable, to demonstrate resilience capabilities.
  - Align disclosures with recognized standards such as SASB A&D-CP-330a.2, which requires qualitative disclosure of business continuity risks related to operational disruptions.

#### (1) Number of licences or subscriptions (sasb_30_1_Number_of_licences_or_subscriptions)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments were retrieved based on the keyword 'number' with a consistent but low match score of 0.333, none of the content directly references or discloses the specific metric 'Number of licences or subscriptions' (sasb_30_1_Number_of_licences_or_subscriptions). The retrieved segments primarily mention general numerical facts about Dell Technologies, such as revenue, number of employees, countries of operation, and R&D investment, but there is no mention of software licences, user subscriptions, or any related quantification that would align with the defined metric. The retrieval was keyword-based rather than semantic, indicating weak relevance. No explicit or implicit data related to licensing or subscription models was found in the provided content.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S006, P004_S010, P005_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the total number of software licences or subscriptions offered or sold during the reporting period to meet SASB standards.
  - Include a dedicated section or table for product usage metrics, clearly differentiating between perpetual licences, term licences, and cloud-based subscriptions.
  - Enhance document indexing and tagging to ensure metrics are linked to relevant disclosures using standardized ESG frameworks like SASB.

#### (2) percentage cloud-based (sasb_31_2_percentage_cloud-based)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention metrics with the word 'percentage'—such as percentage reduction in GHG emissions, percentage of electricity from renewable sources, and percentage of product content from sustainable materials—none of these relate to the specific metric 'percentage cloud-based' (sasb_31_2_percentage_cloud-based). The retrieved segments were identified through keyword matching focused on the term 'percentage', which explains the low match scores (0.500) and lack of semantic relevance. There is no mention of cloud-based infrastructure, cloud migration, or related KPIs in any of the provided content. Furthermore, the tag information indicates that all retrievals were keyword-based with moderate scores, suggesting weak contextual alignment. As such, there is no evidence of disclosure for this specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P008_T000, P008_S007, P008_S011
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the percentage of IT infrastructure or workloads hosted on cloud-based platforms to align with SASB Standard sasb_31_2_percentage_cloud-based.
  - Include cloud adoption metrics in future sustainability reports, broken down by public, private, and hybrid cloud environments if applicable.
  - Enhance metadata tagging and semantic indexing to improve retrieval accuracy for ESG metric queries.

#### (1) Data processing capacity (sasb_32_1_Data_processing_capacity)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention keywords such as 'data' and 'capacity' or 'processing', none of them provide a direct disclosure of the metric 'Data processing capacity' (sasb_32_1_Data_processing_capacity). The term appears to be related to IT infrastructure or computational capability, but the retrieved content focuses on data availability limitations (Segment 1), privacy standards for personal data processing (Segment 2), and methodological challenges in measuring social impact due to data granularity and partner verification capacity (Segments 3, 4, 5). These references are contextually about data management constraints or programmatic capacity, not quantitative metrics on data processing infrastructure, throughput, or system capacity. All segments were retrieved via keyword matching with a moderate score (0.667), indicating only partial relevance, and no semantic matches were present. There is no numerical value, unit of measure, or descriptive explanation that directly corresponds to data processing capacity as an operational or technological performance indicator.
- **Evidence Segments**: P023_S010, P071_S007, P091_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly define and report the 'Data processing capacity' metric using standardized units (e.g., teraflops, transactions per second, data volume processed annually) to align with SASB standards.
  - Clarify whether the metric refers to internal IT systems, cloud infrastructure, edge computing, or customer-facing platforms to improve contextual understanding.
  - Improve indexing and tagging of ESG reports with semantic metadata to enhance retrieval accuracy for specific sustainability metrics.

#### (2) percentage outsourced (sasb_33_2_percentage_outsourced)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention percentages related to ESG performance (e.g., percentage reduction in GHG emissions, percentage of renewable energy, and percentage of recycled content), none of the retrieved content directly addresses the specific metric 'percentage outsourced' (SASB code sasb_33_2_percentage_outsourced). The keyword-based retrievals are triggered by the word 'percentage', but all identified data points pertain to environmental performance indicators under sustainability goals, not to outsourcing or supply chain labor practices. There is no mention of outsourced operations, services, or workforce as would be required for this SASB metric. Furthermore, the tag information indicates that all matches are keyword-based with moderate scores (0.500), suggesting limited contextual relevance. No semantic matches were retrieved, reinforcing the absence of meaningful disclosure on this topic.
- **Evidence Segments**: P008_T000, P008_S007, P008_S011
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose the percentage of business functions or manufacturing processes that are outsourced, particularly in relation to labor-intensive operations, to align with SASB standards.
  - Include a dedicated section or table summarizing outsourcing practices, including geographic distribution and risk management strategies.
  - Enhance semantic discoverability by using standardized terminology such as 'outsourced activities', 'third-party contractors', or 'supplier-managed operations' in future reports.

#### (1) Amount of data storage (sasb_34_1_Amount_of_data_storage)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments reference data storage and related technologies (e.g., 'external storage', 'data center storage', 'enterprise data storage reductions'), none of the retrieved content provides a quantified or specific disclosure for the metric 'Amount of data storage' (sasb_34_1_Amount_of_data_storage). The mentions are contextual, focusing on product offerings, energy efficiency, market leadership, and environmental impact (e.g., CO2e emissions from use of storage systems), but do not report any measurable amount of data stored, capacity, volume, or similar metric. All segments were retrieved via keyword matching with high scores (0.667), indicating strong topical relevance to 'storage' and 'data', but the retrieval type was keyword-based rather than semantic, suggesting the system matched surface-level terms rather than deeper conceptual disclosures. Despite this, no actual numerical or descriptive data about the quantity of data storage is present. Therefore, while the topic is contextually addressed, there is no direct or indirect disclosure of the required metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P006_T000, P006_S008, P020_S001
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose the total amount of data storage capacity managed, sold, or utilized in operations, preferably in standardized units such as petabytes (PB) or exabytes (EB).
  - Differentiate between storage products sold, storage capacity deployed in services, and internal organizational data storage if applicable.
  - Include time-series data to show trends over recent fiscal years to enhance transparency and support ESG benchmarking.
  - Align disclosures with SASB standards by ensuring metrics are defined, measured consistently, and auditable.

#### (2) percentage outsourced (sasb_35_2_percentage_outsourced)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention percentages related to ESG performance (e.g., percentage reduction in GHG emissions, percentage of renewable energy usage, percentage of recycled content), none of the retrieved content directly addresses the specific metric 'percentage outsourced' (SASB Code: sasb_35_2_percentage_outsourced). This metric pertains to the proportion of business functions or manufacturing processes that are outsourced, which is a key governance and supply chain transparency indicator under SASB standards for certain industries. The retrieved segments are all focused on environmental performance metrics such as emissions reductions and circular economy goals, and were identified through keyword matching on the term 'percentage', rather than semantic relevance to outsourcing. The retrieval type is keyword-based with a moderate match score (0.500), indicating limited contextual alignment. There is no mention of outsourcing, third-party manufacturing, supplier dependency, or operational outsourcing ratios in any segment. Therefore, despite the presence of percentage-based data, the specific metric in question is not disclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P008_T000, P008_S007, P008_S011
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose the percentage of operations or production that is outsourced, particularly in manufacturing and logistics, to meet SASB compliance expectations.
  - Include a dedicated section on supply chain structure and outsourcing practices in future ESG reports, with clear definitions and quantified metrics.
  - Enhance semantic tagging of ESG disclosures to ensure relevant metrics are accurately retrievable based on both keywords and context.

### ⚠️ Partially Disclosed

#### (2) percentage grid electricity (sasb_1_2_percentage_grid_electricity)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'percentage grid electricity' (sasb_1_2_percentage_grid_electricity) relates to the proportion of electricity consumed by the company that is sourced from the grid, which is essential for understanding indirect emissions (Scope 2) and renewable energy sourcing. While the company does not explicitly disclose the percentage of total electricity derived from the grid, it provides closely related information: in Segment 2, it reports that 61.5% of electricity was sourced from renewable sources in FY24, implying that the remainder (38.5%) came from non-renewable grid sources. This allows for an indirect inference about grid electricity usage. Additionally, Segment 1 clarifies that the company uses market-based accounting for Scope 2 emissions and tracks renewable electricity purchases, further supporting the interpretation of grid dependency. However, there is no direct breakdown of total electricity consumption split between self-generated, renewable-purchased, and conventional grid sources. The absence of an explicit figure for 'percentage grid electricity' limits the completeness of disclosure. Although multiple segments mention electricity, renewable sources, and emissions factors (Segments 1, 2, 4, 5), these are primarily focused on renewable procurement and product-related carbon footprints rather than operational grid dependence. The retrieval types are mostly keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.429–0.714), indicating relevance but not high contextual precision. Overall, while sufficient data exists to infer partial insights, the lack of a direct, transparent metric reduces the disclosure quality.
- **Evidence Segments**: P102_T000, P008_T000, P038_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the percentage of total electricity consumed that comes from the grid versus on-site or off-site renewables.
  - Provide a clear breakdown of electricity sources (grid, purchased renewable, on-site generation) to improve transparency and alignment with SASB standards.
  - Include absolute electricity consumption data (in MWh or GWh) alongside percentages to enable better benchmarking and third-party analysis.
  - Clarify whether the reported renewable electricity percentage includes both physical procurement (e.g., PPAs) and instrument-based claims (e.g., RECs or GOs).

#### Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security risks, including use of third-party cybersecurity standards (sasb_17_Description_of_approach_to_identifying_and_address)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The company provides a partial but meaningful description of its approach to identifying and addressing data security risks, with emphasis on cybersecurity frameworks and third-party standards. The Zero Trust model is explicitly referenced (Segment 4) as a core security approach, which reflects a modern strategy for managing cybersecurity risks in a distributed digital environment. Additionally, the use of third-party cybersecurity standards is demonstrated through references to U.S. government-accredited validation processes (e.g., Project Fort Zero), RBA-certified auditors (Segment 3), and alignment with international standards such as OECD Due Diligence Guidance (Segment 1). The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) initiative (Segments 2 and 5) further supports transparency in third-party software components, directly linking to data security risk identification. However, while these elements collectively indicate a structured approach, there is no comprehensive, integrated narrative that explicitly outlines end-to-end processes for identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring data security risks across the organization. The disclosure lacks specific methodologies, risk assessment tools, frequency of assessments, or integration with enterprise-wide risk management frameworks. Furthermore, although multiple segments mention 'third-party' and 'security', they are contextually dispersed across supply chain due diligence, product transparency, and internal security models, rather than forming a unified data security risk management policy. The keyword-based retrieval with moderate match scores (0.300–0.500) and absence of high-scoring semantic matches suggest relevance but not depth or centrality of the topic in the report.
- **Evidence Segments**: P065_S008, P067_T000, P060_S011
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a consolidated overview of the company's data security risk identification and mitigation framework, including governance structure, risk assessment cycles, and escalation procedures.
  - Clarify how cybersecurity standards (e.g., NIST, ISO/IEC 27001) are specifically adopted or aligned within internal policies and technical controls.
  - Include examples of threat modeling, penetration testing, incident response protocols, or cyber resilience metrics to strengthen evidence of proactive risk management.
  - Differentiate between product-level security approaches (e.g., SBOM, Zero Trust in devices) and corporate IT security practices to avoid conflation and improve clarity.
  - Enhance disclosure by describing how third-party cybersecurity certifications or audit results are used to enforce vendor risk management and contractual compliance.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (c) technical employees (sasb_23_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric in question—'Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (c) technical employees'—specifically calls for data on two diversity groups (likely gender and race/ethnicity) among technical employees. While the provided segments disclose relevant diversity metrics, they do not clearly isolate or define 'technical employees' as a distinct category. However, multiple high-scoring keyword-based retrievals (Segments 1 and 5, both with match scores of 0.600 and 0.400 respectively) provide detailed disclosures on workforce diversity, including breakdowns by gender (women) and race/ethnicity (Black/African American or Hispanic/Latino), both globally and in the U.S., and across workforce and leadership levels. Segment 4 further supports this with granular racial/ethnic representation data, though it does not distinguish between technical and non-technical roles. The methodology in Segment 5 confirms that data is self-reported and scoped to specific employee populations, enhancing transparency. Despite the comprehensive nature of the disclosed goals and metrics, the lack of explicit segmentation for 'technical employees' limits the precision of the disclosure for this particular SASB metric. This omission reduces the disclosure quality from high to medium, as core data elements are present but not fully aligned with the required disaggregation.
- **Evidence Segments**: P047_T000, P108_T000, P047_S006
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report diversity metrics segmented by technical vs. non-technical employee categories to align with SASB TC-HW-330a requirements.
  - Clarify the definition of 'technical employees' in the report to improve transparency and comparability.
  - Include self-identification rates or data coverage percentages to assess completeness of demographic reporting.
  - Enhance cross-referencing between KPI tables and narrative sections to strengthen traceability of disclosed metrics.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (d) all other employees (sasb_24_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (d) all other employees' under SASB code sasb_24_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f requires disclosure of representation data for two diversity groups across all non-executive or non-leadership employees (i.e., 'all other employees'). Multiple segments provide relevant data, particularly from pages 47, 90, and 104, with keyword-based retrieval and moderate match scores (0.600), indicating alignment with core terms like 'percentage,' 'representation,' 'workforce,' and 'global.' Segment 1 and Segment 3 clearly outline goals and current performance for women and U.S. racial/ethnic groups (Black/African American or Hispanic/Latino) in both the global and U.S. workforce. Segment 2 provides detailed FY24 breakdowns by race/ethnicity in the U.S. non-technical roles, which aligns with 'all other employees' if interpreted as non-leadership roles. However, the data is not explicitly labeled as 'all other employees,' nor is there a direct aggregation of exactly two diversity groups specifically for that category. While the information is highly related and allows inference, the lack of explicit framing around 'all other employees' and combined reporting of the two required diversity groups reduces precision. The presence of methodology details in Segment 3 enhances credibility but does not fully compensate for the absence of a direct metric label match.
- **Evidence Segments**: P047_T000, P090_T000, P104_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly define and report the metric for 'all other employees' separately from leadership to improve clarity and compliance with SASB specificity requirements.
  - Directly state the combined percentage for the two specified diversity groups (e.g., women and underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities) within the 'all other employees' category to ensure full transparency.
  - Improve metadata tagging with semantic matching to enhance retrieval accuracy for ESG metrics, especially for nuanced workforce categories.

### ✅ Fully Disclosed

#### (1) Total energy consumed (sasb_0_1_Total_energy_consumed)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'Total energy consumed' (sasb_0_1_Total_energy_consumed) is clearly disclosed in Segment 4, which provides a detailed table with actual quantitative data for fiscal years FY22, FY23, and FY24 (1,063, 1,038, and 996 million kWh respectively). The data is explicitly labeled under the exact metric name and includes contextual notes confirming that the figures cover all global facilities, including leased spaces and company-owned/leased transportation. This aligns directly with SASB standards for energy consumption disclosure.

Segment 1 provides a detailed methodology for calculating the percentage of electricity from renewable sources, explicitly referencing RE100 criteria and GHG Protocol standards, indicating robust disclosure practices. Segment 3 directly reports the current performance value (61.5% in FY24) against the stated goal of 75% by 2030, demonstrating quantitative transparency. Segment 2 reinforces this by listing renewable energy under key performance indicators and including related data on renewable materials, further supporting comprehensive environmental reporting. The retrieval types are primarily keyword-based with high match scores (up to 0.833), and the content consistently links to SASB and other recognized frameworks (e.g., GRI, CDP), enhancing credibility. All evidence collectively indicates that the organization not only discloses the metric but does so with methodological clarity, current performance data, and strategic context.
- **Evidence Segments**: P102_T000, P109_T000, P008_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a year-on-year trend analysis of the percentage renewable to enhance transparency on progress trajectory.
  - Clarify whether the 61.5% figure uses market-based or location-based accounting for consistency with Scope 2 emissions reporting.
  - Include geographic breakdown of renewable sourcing to support regional stakeholder engagement and risk assessment.

#### Description of policies and practices relating to targeted advertising and user privacy (sasb_7_Description_of_policies_and_practices_relating_to_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments collectively demonstrate comprehensive and specific disclosure regarding policies and practices related to user privacy and targeted advertising. Multiple high-relevance keyword matches (with scores up to 0.500) from different sections of the ESG report—including narrative descriptions, governance tables, and policy frameworks—confirm that Dell has established formal mechanisms for managing user data and privacy. The company explicitly references its Global Data Privacy Policy, the role of the Chief Privacy Officer, use of the NIST Privacy Framework, and operational initiatives like the enhanced Privacy Center available in 74 global locations. Additionally, strategic goals such as improving customer control over personal data and implementing Zero Trust security solutions indicate proactive practices aligned with user privacy expectations. Although 'targeted advertising' is not explicitly detailed, the emphasis on transparency, data subject rights automation, SBOM publication, and customer choice strongly implies coverage of digital privacy practices relevant to online interactions and data usage. The consistency across content types (narrative, tabular, policy) and presence of measurable goals and implementation status supports a high-quality disclosure.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P010_T000, P071_S011
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly address targeted advertising practices, including whether user data is used or shared for behavioral advertising purposes.
  - Provide clearer differentiation between general privacy controls and those specifically applicable to digital marketing or ad technologies.

  - Enhance transparency by disclosing any third-party data sharing arrangements for advertising purposes, even if limited.

#### Employee engagement as a percentage (sasb_19_Employee_engagement_as_a_percentage)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'Employee engagement as a percentage' (sasb_19_Employee_engagement_as_a_percentage) is explicitly disclosed in Segment 1, where it states 'Employee engagement as a percentage: 87%' for FY2024. This data point is directly mapped to the SASB standard TC-SI-330a.2, confirming alignment with recognized ESG reporting frameworks. The segment is retrieved via keyword matching with a high match score of 0.556 and includes relevant keywords such as 'engagement', 'employee', and 'percentage', indicating strong relevance. While other segments mention related concepts like workforce diversity, inclusion, volunteerism, and employee resource group participation, they do not report on employee engagement specifically. However, these provide contextual support for broader workforce accountability and inclusive culture initiatives, reinforcing the credibility and comprehensiveness of the disclosure environment. The presence of clear quantitative data, a defined time frame (FY2024), and a direct reference to SASB confirms a high-quality disclosure.

#### Percentage of (1) gender (sasb_20_Percentage_of_1_gender)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'Percentage of (1) gender' (specifically focusing on women in the workforce) is clearly disclosed across multiple segments, with consistent data presented in both tabular and textual formats. The primary data point—'Percentage of our global workforce who identify as women: FY24 35.0%'—is explicitly stated in high-relevance keyword-based retrievals (Segment 1 and Segment 2), which also provide context such as long-term goals (50% by 2030) and related metrics for leadership representation. Although two segments (Segment 3 and Segment 5) incorrectly state the percentage as 50%, this appears to be a typographical or data entry error, likely conflating the current performance with the 2030 target. Despite this inconsistency, the correct figure (35.0%) is reinforced in higher-scoring and more detailed segments (e.g., Segment 1 with match score 0.500), increasing confidence in its accuracy. The presence of structured tables, goal alignment, and cross-referencing with SDGs enhances transparency and completeness. The retrieval types are all keyword-based, indicating direct mention of key terms like 'percentage', 'global', and 'workforce', further supporting strong disclosure. Overall, the information is comprehensive, multi-sourced, and includes both current performance and future targets.
