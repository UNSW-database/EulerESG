## Detailed Analysis Results

### ❌ Not Disclosed

#### (1) Total energy consumed (sasb_0_1_Total_energy_consumed)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are derived from a technical research paper on a reinforcement learning method called HCPI-HRL, which focuses on inferring subgoal structures using human causal perception in dynamic environments. While the term 'environmental' appears multiple times and is the basis for retrieval (with low match scores of 0.143 across all segments), it refers exclusively to simulated or abstract environments in the context of AI agent training—not physical, ecological, or operational environments related to energy consumption. The retrieval was triggered purely by keyword matching on 'environmental', but the semantic context is entirely unrelated to ESG or energy metrics. There is no mention of energy usage, units of measurement (e.g., kWh, MWh), energy sources, or any data relevant to 'Total energy consumed'. All segments discuss algorithmic design, causal inference, and agent learning, with no connection to corporate sustainability reporting, operational resource use, or environmental impact assessment. Therefore, despite the presence of the keyword, there is no actual disclosure related to the metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P002_S002, P002_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve retrieval precision by combining keyword filters with semantic relevance thresholds to avoid false positives from loosely matched terms.
  - Include domain-specific context checks to distinguish between technical uses of terms like 'environmental' (e.g., in AI simulations) versus ESG-related physical environmental factors.
  - Expand metadata tagging to include contextual disambiguation (e.g., 'simulated environment' vs. 'natural environment') to enhance filtering accuracy.

#### (2) percentage grid electricity (sasb_1_2_percentage_grid_electricity)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are focused on a machine learning methodology called HCPI-HRL (Human Causal Perception and Inference-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning), which involves subgoal structure inference in dynamic environments using causal modeling and human-guided perception. While the term 'environmental' appears multiple times and was likely the keyword used for retrieval (with all segments showing the same match score of 0.143 and retrieval type as keyword), the context refers to simulated or abstract 'environments' in reinforcement learning tasks, not physical or ecological environments related to ESG reporting. There is no mention of energy sources, electricity consumption, grid dependency, or any data relevant to the metric 'percentage grid electricity'. The tag information confirms that the relevance is based solely on the keyword 'environmental', with low match scores and no semantic linkage to sustainability or energy metrics. Therefore, the content is entirely unrelated to the ESG metric in question.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P002_S002, P002_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval systems use semantic matching rather than relying solely on superficial keyword matches to avoid irrelevant results.
  - Include domain-specific filters to distinguish between technical AI/ML usage of terms like 'environmental' and their use in ESG/sustainability contexts.
  - Expand search queries to include synonyms and related terms such as 'electricity source', 'grid power', 'energy mix', or 'utility electricity' to improve recall for this metric.

#### (3) percentage renewable (sasb_2_3_percentage_renewable)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are focused on a machine learning methodology called HCPI-HRL (Human Causal Perception and Inference-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning), which involves subgoal structure inference in dynamic environments using causal modeling and human-guided perception. While the term 'environmental' appears frequently and is the basis for keyword-based retrieval (with consistent 0.167 match scores across all segments), it refers exclusively to simulated or abstract 'environments' in the context of reinforcement learning tasks, not physical or natural environments related to energy sources or sustainability. There is no mention of renewable energy, energy consumption, power sources, or any quantitative data related to the percentage of renewable energy usage. The metric 'sasb_2_3_percentage_renewable' pertains to environmental sustainability reporting, specifically the proportion of renewable energy used by an organization, which is entirely unrelated to the content of the provided segments. The low keyword match scores and lack of semantic relevance confirm that the material does not address the ESG metric in question.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P002_S002, P002_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval systems differentiate between technical uses of terms like 'environmental' in AI/ML contexts versus sustainability-related meanings.
  - Expand search queries to include explicit synonyms and indicators of renewable energy metrics such as 'renewable energy percentage', 'clean energy usage', 'energy mix', or 'renewable electricity'.
  - Apply domain-specific filtering to exclude non-ESG technical research papers when analyzing ESG compliance metrics.

#### (1) Total water withdrawn (sasb_3_1_Total_water_withdrawn)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are entirely focused on a machine learning methodology called HCPI-HRL (Human Causal Perception and Inference-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning), which involves subgoal structure inference in dynamic environments using causal modeling and human-guided perception. While the term 'environmental' appears multiple times and was likely the keyword used for retrieval (with low match scores of 0.143 across all segments), it refers to simulated or abstract 'environments' in the context of reinforcement learning, not natural or physical environments related to ESG or water usage. There is no mention of water withdrawal, resource consumption, operational data, environmental impact metrics, or any ESG-related disclosures. The retrieval type is keyword-based with uniformly low match scores, indicating weak relevance. None of the content pertains to corporate sustainability practices, water management, or measurable environmental performance indicators. As such, there is no evidence of disclosure for the metric 'Total water withdrawn'.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P002_S002, P002_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval systems are calibrated to distinguish between technical uses of terms like 'environmental' in AI/ML contexts versus ESG-related environmental reporting.
  - Expand keyword lists to include synonyms and contextual phrases related to water withdrawal (e.g., 'water consumption', 'withdrawal volume', 'freshwater use') to improve precision in future retrievals.
  - Incorporate semantic filtering to exclude non-ESG technical domains when analyzing sustainability metrics.

#### (2) total water consumed (sasb_4_2_total_water_consumed)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are entirely focused on a machine learning methodology called HCPI-HRL (Human Causal Perception and Inference-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning), which involves subgoal structure inference in dynamic environments using causal modeling and human-guided perception. While the term 'environmental' appears frequently and is the basis for retrieval (with matching keywords and low but consistent match scores of 0.143 across all segments), it refers exclusively to simulated or abstract environments in the context of reinforcement learning, not physical or natural environments. There is no mention of water consumption, resource usage, or any environmental sustainability metrics related to corporate operations or ESG reporting. The retrieval was likely triggered due to keyword matching on 'environmental', but the context is computational and AI-focused, not environmental stewardship or resource management. Therefore, there is no relevant disclosure regarding 'total water consumed' as an ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P002_S002, P002_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval systems differentiate between technical uses of terms like 'environmental' in AI/ML contexts versus ecological or sustainability contexts to avoid false positives.
  - Expand keyword tagging with contextual disambiguation to improve precision in ESG metric extraction.
  - If this document is part of a larger corpus, consider supplementing with sections from sustainability reports, environmental impact assessments, or operational disclosures where water consumption data may be reported.

#### (3) percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress (sasb_5_3_percentage_of_each_in_regions_with_High_or_Ext)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are primarily focused on reinforcement learning methodologies, experimental setups, and performance comparisons of various algorithms (e.g., HCPI-HRL, PPO, HPPO, APPO) in simulated environments. While the keywords 'each', 'with', and 'baseline' appear across multiple segments—triggering retrieval based on keyword matching—the context is entirely technical and related to machine learning model evaluation, not environmental, social, or governance (ESG) metrics. The metric in question, 'percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress', pertains to geographic and environmental risk assessment, particularly water stress exposure by operational region. None of the segments mention water stress, geographic regions, resource usage, environmental impact assessments, or any related ESG data. The term 'baseline' in the retrieved content refers to benchmark models in machine learning, not baseline water stress conditions. Furthermore, all retrieval types are keyword-based with low match scores (0.300 and 0.200), indicating weak relevance. There is no semantic alignment with the intended ESG metric. Therefore, there is no actual disclosure of the requested metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P007_S009, P010_S009, P011_S006
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that ESG-related queries are matched with documents containing environmental impact reports, sustainability disclosures, or geographic risk assessments.
  - Improve retrieval precision by incorporating semantic understanding to distinguish between homonymous terms such as 'baseline' in ML vs. environmental contexts.
  - Include metadata filtering (e.g., document type, topic tags) to exclude non-ESG technical research papers when analyzing ESG compliance metrics.

#### Discussion of the integration of environmental considerations into strategic planning for data centre needs (sasb_6_Discussion_of_the_integration_of_environmental_con)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments, while containing keywords such as 'integration', 'into', and 'planning', are contextually unrelated to the environmental considerations in strategic planning for data centre needs. The content predominantly discusses hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), subgoal discovery, and integration of human reasoning or causal models in AI/ML systems. The keyword matches are superficial and stem from technical AI research literature, with no mention of data centres, environmental sustainability, energy efficiency, carbon footprint, cooling systems, renewable energy integration, or any related environmental factors relevant to data centre infrastructure or strategic planning. The retrieval type is primarily keyword-based with low match scores (0.100–0.200), indicating weak relevance. There is no semantic alignment with the ESG metric's intent, which focuses on how environmental impacts are formally considered in the strategic development and scaling of data centre operations.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S013, P002_S008, P003_S015
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure document corpus includes sustainability reports, corporate responsibility disclosures, or infrastructure strategy documents that specifically address data centre operations.
  - Refine search queries to include domain-specific terms such as 'data centre environmental strategy', 'green data centre planning', 'energy-efficient data centre design', or 'sustainability in data centre expansion'.
  - Incorporate semantic search techniques trained on ESG contexts to improve relevance and reduce false positives from unrelated technical domains like machine learning.
  - Verify that source documents cover SASB Standard UCP-DP-140a.1, which explicitly requires disclosure of how environmental considerations are integrated into strategic planning for data centre capacity and infrastructure.

#### Description of policies and practices relating to targeted advertising and user privacy (sasb_7_Description_of_policies_and_practices_relating_to_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily focused on technical aspects of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), particularly methods for subgoal discovery, policy optimization using PPO, and data-driven approaches in AI agent training. While the keyword 'policies' appears in multiple segments (Segments 1, 4, 5) and 'data' in others (Segments 2, 3), these terms are used in a machine learning context—referring to decision policies in reinforcement learning and data-driven model training—not in relation to corporate policies or practices concerning targeted advertising and user privacy. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with low match scores (0.100), indicating weak relevance. There is no mention of user privacy frameworks, data protection policies, consent mechanisms, advertising practices, regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), or any organizational governance related to digital marketing or personal data handling. Therefore, despite superficial keyword overlaps, the content is entirely unrelated to the ESG metric in question.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P001_S014, P002_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure document corpus includes policy documents, privacy statements, or sustainability reports that explicitly address user data handling and advertising practices.
  - Refine retrieval queries to include semantic synonyms such as 'privacy policy', 'targeted advertising guidelines', 'data consent', 'user tracking disclosure', and 'advertising ethics'.
  - Incorporate sources like company websites, investor ESG filings, or third-party audit reports where such disclosures are more likely to appear.
  - Apply domain-specific filtering to exclude technical research papers unrelated to corporate governance or social responsibility topics.

#### Number of users whose information is used for secondary purposes (sasb_8_Number_of_users_whose_information_is_used_for_seco)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are primarily focused on technical aspects of hierarchical reinforcement learning, causal inference, schema learning, and Bayesian modeling in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. While the keyword 'data' appears across several segments—triggering low to moderate match scores (0.100–0.200)—the context consistently refers to synthetic, experimental, or event data used in machine learning and cognitive modeling, not user data privacy or secondary usage of personal information. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based, indicating that matches were driven by generic terms like 'data' and 'number', rather than semantic relevance to the metric's intended meaning. There is no mention of user consent, data governance, privacy policies, or any quantified disclosures regarding users whose information is used for secondary purposes. The term 'users' does not appear at all, and there is no indication of personal data processing activities. Therefore, despite superficial keyword overlaps, none of the content addresses the ESG-related disclosure requirement of this metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P002_S008, P001_S014, P003_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure source documents include explicit sections on data privacy practices, particularly regarding secondary use of user information.
  - Include quantitative disclosures such as the number of users affected, types of data processed, and purposes of reuse, aligned with SASB standards.
  - Enhance document indexing with domain-specific terminology (e.g., 'secondary data use', 'user consent', 'data sharing') to improve retrieval accuracy for ESG audits.

#### Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with user privacy (sasb_9_Total_amount_of_monetary_losses_as_a_result_of_leg)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily focused on Bayesian inference, subgoal discovery, and agent-environment interactions in reinforcement learning systems. While the keyword 'associated' appears frequently—especially in relation to schemas, attributes, and environmental objects—this linguistic overlap is superficial and contextually unrelated to the ESG metric in question. The metric 'Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with user privacy' requires disclosure of financial impacts from legal actions tied to privacy violations. None of the segments mention legal proceedings, user privacy, data breaches, regulatory fines, litigation costs, or any related financial disclosures. All segments originate from a technical AI/ML context (evidenced by references to MuJoCo, Safety-Gymnasium, Bayesian learning), and the low match scores (0.200) combined with keyword-based retrieval indicate weak relevance. There is no semantic or factual alignment between the content and the ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P004_S002, P004_S006, P004_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document indexing by distinguishing domain-specific terminology to reduce false positives from irrelevant technical literature.
  - Expand retrieval methods to include semantic search with contextual embeddings to better filter out irrelevant uses of common keywords like 'associated'.
  - Ensure source documents cover legal, compliance, and financial risk reporting sections where such ESG-related monetary loss data would typically be disclosed.

#### (1) Number of law enforcement requests for user information (sasb_10_1_Number_of_law_enforcement_requests_for_user_in)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily focused on technical aspects of hierarchical reinforcement learning, causal inference, and schema-based learning in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. While the keyword 'data' appears across multiple segments—triggering low to moderate match scores (0.100–0.200)—there is no substantive mention or discussion of law enforcement requests for user information. The metric in question pertains to transparency in data governance and user privacy compliance, particularly in relation to government or legal disclosures. None of the segments reference legal compliance, user data requests, law enforcement interactions, or any related quantitative reporting. The tag information indicates that retrieval was based solely on keyword matching (e.g., 'number', 'data'), with no semantic relevance to the ESG metric. The context of 'number' in Segment 1 refers to algorithmic exploration methods, not reported statistics. Overall, there is no evidence of disclosure relevant to the specified metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P002_S008, P001_S014, P003_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document indexing by incorporating semantic tagging related to ESG, data privacy, and legal compliance to reduce false positives from irrelevant technical content.
  - Ensure that reports include dedicated sections on user data requests and law enforcement interactions, aligned with frameworks such as SASB or GRI.
  - Enhance keyword filtering by combining them with contextual qualifiers (e.g., 'law enforcement', 'user data request') to improve retrieval precision for ESG metrics.

#### (2) number of users whose information was requested (sasb_11_2_number_of_users_whose_information_was_requeste)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are primarily focused on technical aspects of hierarchical reinforcement learning, causal inference, schema learning, and Bayesian modeling in AI systems. While the keyword 'data' appears across several segments—triggering retrieval with low match scores (0.111 for most, 0.222 for one)—there is no mention of user data requests, legal disclosures, government inquiries, or any related privacy or compliance reporting context. The term 'number of users whose information was requested' does not appear or relate to the content, which is academic and theoretical in nature, discussing algorithmic and cognitive frameworks rather than organizational ESG metrics. The retrieval was based solely on keyword matching (not semantic relevance), and none of the segments reference real-world data governance practices, transparency reports, or user privacy metrics. Therefore, there is no evidence of disclosure for this specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P002_S008, P001_S014, P003_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that future document submissions include dedicated sections on data privacy and government data requests, especially if reporting under ESG or SASB standards.
  - Include quantitative disclosures regarding the number of user information requests received from governmental or third-party entities during the reporting period.
  - Enhance metadata tagging with semantic labels related to 'data privacy', 'user rights', and 'compliance disclosures' to improve retrieval accuracy for ESG metrics.

####  (3) percentage resulting in disclosure (sasb_12__3_percentage_resulting_in_disclosure)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily focused on technical aspects of hierarchical reinforcement learning, cognitive modeling, and causal inference frameworks in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. While the term 'data' appears across all segments and was likely the keyword used for retrieval, none of the content relates to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) performance metrics or corporate disclosures. Specifically, there is no mention of any numerical percentage, disclosure rate, compliance statistics, or ESG-related reporting practices tied to the metric 'sasb_12__3_percentage_resulting_in_disclosure'. The high match scores (0.143 each) based on keyword retrieval appear to stem from generic use of the word 'data', which lacks contextual relevance to the intended ESG metric. Furthermore, no semantic linkage can be established between the provided text and SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) standards or disclosure calculations. As such, there is no evidence of actual disclosure for this specific metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S014, P002_S008, P003_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval systems are tuned to prioritize contextually relevant ESG disclosures rather than relying solely on superficial keyword matches like 'data'.
  - Incorporate semantic understanding models trained on ESG reporting terminology to improve precision in matching metrics to relevant content.
  - Verify source documents for explicit references to SASB metric codes and required quantitative disclosures to avoid false positives from irrelevant technical literature.

#### List of countries where core products or services are subject to government-required monitoring, blocking, content filtering, or censoring (sasb_13_List_of_countries_where_core_products_or_services_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily derived from a scientific paper on reinforcement learning and causal inference in AI systems. Although the keyword matches include 'list' and 'where', which partially align with the metric name, these terms appear in technical algorithmic or mathematical contexts (e.g., 'list of available contents', 'where conditions change randomly', or 'where discount factor γ∈[0,1)'). None of the segments mention countries, government requirements, monitoring, censorship, blocking, or content filtering related to core products or services. The retrieval type is keyword-based with low match scores (0.100), indicating weak relevance. There is no semantic or contextual evidence that the company discloses information about countries where its products are subject to governmental control. Therefore, there is no meaningful disclosure for this ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S001, P001_S015, P002_S007
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Include a dedicated section in the ESG or sustainability report listing all countries where the company's core products or services are subject to government-mandated monitoring, filtering, or censorship.
  - Provide context for each listed country, such as the legal basis, scope of compliance, and human rights implications.
  - Enhance document indexing and metadata to ensure that disclosures related to digital rights and freedom of expression are accurately retrievable via both keyword and semantic search methods.

#### (1) Number of data breaches (sasb_14_1_Number_of_data_breaches)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily focused on hierarchical reinforcement learning, causal inference, schema learning, and data-driven modeling in AI and cognitive science contexts. While the keyword 'data' appears frequently across segments—triggering keyword-based retrieval with low to moderate match scores (0.250–0.500)—the term is used in a general research or methodological sense (e.g., 'event data', 'sparse data', 'training data') rather than in the context of cybersecurity or information security incidents. The specific metric 'Number of data breaches' (sasb_14_1_Number_of_data_breaches) pertains to the disclosure of actual organizational incidents involving unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data. None of the segments mention data breaches, security incidents, cyber attacks, or any quantified reporting of such events. Furthermore, all matches are keyword-based with no semantic relevance to ESG, cybersecurity risk management, or corporate disclosure practices. There is no evidence of structured or numerical disclosure related to data breach occurrences.
- **Evidence Segments**: P002_S008, P001_S014, P003_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that documents submitted for ESG reporting contain dedicated sections on cybersecurity risk management and incident disclosure.
  - Include quantitative metrics such as the number of reported data breaches, their impact, and remediation actions taken during the reporting period.
  - Improve indexing and tagging of ESG-related content to reduce false positives from non-relevant technical literature using similar terminology.
  - Leverage semantic search models trained on ESG frameworks (e.g., SASB, GRI) to enhance retrieval accuracy for compliance analysis.

#### (2) percentage that are personal data breaches (sasb_15_2_percentage_that_are_personal_data_breaches)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments, while containing the keywords 'data' and 'that' (and in one case 'personal'), are entirely unrelated to the ESG metric 'percentage that are personal data breaches'. The content of all segments pertains to technical research in artificial intelligence, specifically hierarchical reinforcement learning, causal modeling, and subgoal discovery in machine learning systems. The mention of 'personal' in Segment 5 appears in the context of disclosing competing interests and not in relation to personal data or data breaches. None of the segments provide any quantitative or qualitative information regarding personal data breaches, their frequency, reporting, or management—key components required for disclosure on this SASB metric. Furthermore, the low match scores (0.333) and keyword-based retrieval type indicate weak relevance, suggesting the matches were based on superficial keyword overlap rather than semantic relevance to the metric topic. As such, there is no meaningful disclosure present.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S014, P002_S008, P003_S013
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document indexing by using domain-specific natural language processing models to distinguish between technical uses of terms like 'data' and 'personal' in non-ESG contexts versus those relevant to privacy and data protection.
  - Expand search queries to include synonyms and related regulatory terminology such as 'data breach incident', 'privacy violation', 'cybersecurity incident', 'number of personal data breaches', or 'data subject breach rate'.
  - Apply semantic filtering to exclude academic or technical AI/ML research content when analyzing ESG compliance metrics unless explicitly linked to organizational risk reporting.

#### (3) number of users affected (sasb_16_3_number_of_users_affected)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are primarily focused on technical aspects of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), causal inference, schema-based reasoning, and Bayesian modeling in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. While the term 'data' appears frequently and is a matched keyword across multiple segments, it refers to experimental or training data in machine learning contexts, not user-related impact metrics. The metric 'number of users affected' (sasb_16_3_number_of_users_affected) pertains to social responsibility and product/service impact disclosure, particularly in assessing how many end-users are impacted by a company's operations or digital platforms. None of the segments mention users, customer bases, service disruptions, algorithmic impacts on individuals, or any quantified population-level effects. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with low to moderate match scores (0.200–0.400), and the only overlapping keyword is 'number' and 'data', which occur in unrelated technical discussions (e.g., subgoal discovery, state transitions, statistical models). There is no semantic or contextual alignment with ESG-related user impact disclosures. Therefore, there is no evidence of disclosure for this specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P002_S008, P001_S014, P003_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Include explicit reporting on user impact assessments, especially for digital services or AI-driven products, detailing the scale of users affected by outages, changes in service, or algorithmic decisions.
  - Integrate quantitative metrics such as 'number of users affected by system downtime', 'users impacted by policy changes', or 'affected user counts from data breaches' to align with SASB standards.
  - Enhance document tagging and indexing using ESG-specific taxonomies to improve retrieval accuracy for sustainability metrics.
  - Ensure that technical research documents referencing data and system performance also link to social impact considerations when applicable for ESG reporting purposes.

#### Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security risks, including use of third-party cybersecurity standards (sasb_17_Description_of_approach_to_identifying_and_address)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily focused on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), human-guided causal inference models, and subgoal generation in AI/ML contexts. While the keyword 'approach' and 'including' appear in multiple segments, these terms are used in a technical machine learning context—referring to algorithmic or training approaches—not in relation to data security risk management or cybersecurity standards. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with low match scores (0.100), indicating weak relevance. No mention of data security risks, cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST), third-party standards, risk identification processes, or mitigation strategies is present. Therefore, despite superficial keyword matches, there is no substantive disclosure related to the specified ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S013, P001_S014, P002_S007
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that documentation includes explicit descriptions of data security risk assessment methodologies.
  - Incorporate references to recognized third-party cybersecurity standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF) to strengthen compliance disclosures.
  - Clearly outline processes for identifying, evaluating, and addressing data security risks across internal and external systems.
  - Improve content specificity by avoiding overuse of generic terms like 'approach' without contextual linkage to security practices.

#### Percentage of employees that require a work visa (sasb_18_Percentage_of_employees_that_require_a_work_visa)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are entirely related to a technical research study on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), specifically focusing on the HCPI-HRL method for inferring subgoal structures in dynamic environments. While the keyword 'require' appears multiple times (e.g., 'the agent is required to obtain the key', 'environment requires to set up a penalty'), these usages are in the context of task requirements for AI agents in simulated environments, not human workforce or employment data. The metric 'Percentage of employees that require a work visa' pertains to human resource and immigration status within an organization, which is completely unrelated to the content of the segments. All retrieval matches are based on low-scoring keyword overlaps (Match Score: 0.100) with generic terms like 'require' and 'diverse', indicating no semantic relevance to workforce composition or visa status. There is no mention of employee demographics, visa sponsorship, international staffing, or any related HR metrics. Therefore, there is no actual disclosure related to the specified ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P002_S002, P005_S007
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure document retrieval systems are tuned to distinguish between homonyms and contextually distinct uses of keywords (e.g., 'require' in technical vs. HR contexts).
  - Incorporate semantic filtering to prioritize documents related to human resources, workforce diversity, or immigration policy when analyzing labor-related ESG metrics.
  - Expand data sources to include HR reports, talent management disclosures, or global mobility programs to capture relevant information on work visa dependencies.

#### Employee engagement as a percentage (sasb_19_Employee_engagement_as_a_percentage)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segment is retrieved based on keyword matching with a low match score (0.111) and is tagged under 'keyword' retrieval type. The content of the segment discusses a technical AI methodology—Human Causal Perception and Inference-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HCPI-HRL)—focused on improving reinforcement learning agents through causal inference. There is no mention of employee engagement, workforce metrics, or any related human resource indicators. The single matched keyword 'diverse' appears to be contextually unrelated to the metric in question. No semantic alignment exists between the segment and the ESG metric 'Employee engagement as a percentage'. Given that all retrieved segments fail to reference workforce practices, engagement surveys, retention, morale, or quantified engagement rates, there is no evidence of disclosure for this metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Include explicit reporting on employee engagement initiatives, survey results, and calculated percentages in sustainability or ESG reports.
  - Ensure disclosures contain measurable data points such as annual engagement rates, participation rates in surveys, and trends over time.
  - Improve document indexing and metadata tagging to enhance semantic retrieval accuracy for ESG-related queries.

#### Percentage of (1) gender (sasb_20_Percentage_of_1_gender)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segment is unrelated to the ESG metric 'Percentage of (1) gender' (SASB code: sasb_20_Percentage_of_1_gender). It discusses a technical artificial intelligence method, HCPI-HRL, involving hierarchical reinforcement learning and causal inference in dynamic environments. The content focuses on algorithmic performance and training efficiency, with no mention of gender diversity, workforce composition, or any related social metrics. The single keyword match on 'diverse' appears in a conceptual context referring to subgoal structures, not demographic diversity. Given the retrieval type is keyword-based with a low match score (0.125), and no semantic relevance to gender reporting, there is no meaningful disclosure present for this ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document indexing by ensuring ESG-related sections (e.g., diversity reports, workforce demographics) are clearly labeled and contain explicit terminology such as 'gender diversity', 'workforce composition', or 'employee demographics'.
  - Enhance retrieval accuracy by incorporating semantic search models trained on ESG taxonomies to better distinguish between homonymous terms like 'diverse' in technical vs. social contexts.
  - Ensure that disclosures for SASB metrics include quantified data points (e.g., percentages of male/female/non-binary employees) in structured formats to facilitate automated extraction.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (a) executive management (sasb_21_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The only retrieved segment is related to a machine learning method (HCPI-HRL) in the context of reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence, discussing concepts such as 'diverse subgoal structures' and 'causal relationships'. While the keyword 'diverse' was matched with a low score (0.100) and triggered retrieval, the content is entirely unrelated to workforce diversity, executive management representation, or any ESG-related human capital disclosure. The segment originates from a technical AI research context and contains no information about employee demographics, diversity metrics, or organizational governance. Given that the retrieval was based on a superficial keyword match with minimal relevance and no semantic connection to the ESG metric, there is no actual disclosure present for the specified metric on percentage representation of diversity groups in executive management.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve keyword filtering to avoid false positives from non-ESG domains when analyzing diversity disclosures.
  - Incorporate semantic understanding models trained on ESG-specific contexts to better distinguish relevant from irrelevant uses of terms like 'diverse'.
  - Expand data sources to include official ESG reports, sustainability disclosures, or corporate governance filings where executive diversity metrics are typically reported.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (b) non-executive management (sasb_22_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The only retrieved segment is related to a machine learning method (HCPI-HRL) in the context of reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence, discussing concepts such as 'diverse subgoal structures' and 'causal relationships'. While the keyword 'diverse' was matched with a low score (0.100) and triggered retrieval, the content is entirely unrelated to workforce diversity, non-executive management, or any ESG-related human resource metrics. The tag information confirms that the match was based solely on keyword overlap without semantic relevance to diversity reporting in organizational management. No data or discussion regarding representation percentages of diversity groups (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity) within non-executive management positions is present. Given the lack of relevant content across all segments, there is no meaningful disclosure for this SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document indexing by enhancing contextual tagging to reduce false positives from irrelevant technical domains.
  - Ensure that ESG reporting documents containing workforce diversity data are included in the knowledge base and properly structured for retrieval.
  - Use more precise semantic search models trained on ESG terminology to avoid keyword-based mismatches.
  - Explicitly map internal HR diversity reports to SASB metric requirements to ensure coverage of non-executive management demographics.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (c) technical employees (sasb_23_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The sole retrieved segment discusses a machine learning method (HCPI-HRL) that involves 'diverse' subgoal structures in the context of reinforcement learning, with the term 'diverse' appearing only as a keyword match. The tag information indicates a low match score (0.100) and the retrieval was based on keyword matching for the word 'diverse', which is semantically unrelated to workforce diversity or employee representation. There is no mention of technical employees, diversity groups (such as gender, race, ethnicity), or any related metrics like percentages or workforce composition. The content is entirely focused on AI/ML research and does not pertain to human resource demographics or ESG reporting. Given the lack of relevant data and the irrelevance of the retrieved content despite the keyword overlap, there is no actual disclosure for the specified metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document indexing by distinguishing between homonymous terms in technical vs. social contexts (e.g., 'diverse' in AI vs. diversity in workforce).
  - Expand search queries to include synonyms and related phrases such as 'technical staff diversity', 'representation of underrepresented groups in engineering', or 'demographics of technical employees'.
  - Incorporate semantic filtering to exclude segments from unrelated domains (e.g., artificial intelligence research) when analyzing ESG human capital metrics.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (d) all other employees (sasb_24_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are derived from a technical research paper on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), specifically focusing on the HCPI-HRL method for improving training efficiency and exploration in AI agents. While the segments contain multiple instances of keywords such as 'diverse' and 'other', these occurrences are contextually related to algorithmic performance, subgoal diversity, and environmental task design—not to workforce composition or diversity metrics. The retrieval was likely triggered by superficial keyword matches (e.g., 'diverse' in Segment 1, 'other' in Segments 2–5), but none of the content addresses employee demographics, representation percentages, or any human resource-related data. All tag information indicates low match scores (0.100) and keyword-based retrieval, suggesting weak relevance. There is no evidence of disclosure related to the SASB metric on diversity group representation among employees.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P007_S011, P009_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval systems differentiate between domain-specific terminology (e.g., 'diverse' in AI contexts) and ESG-related usage to reduce false positives.
  - Expand search queries to include synonyms and contextual phrases related to workforce diversity (e.g., 'employee representation', 'demographic breakdown') rather than relying solely on isolated keywords.
  - Apply semantic filtering to exclude technical or non-ESG domains when analyzing ESG disclosure content.

#### Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with anti-competitive behaviour regulations (sasb_25_Total_amount_of_monetary_losses_as_a_result_of_leg)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are entirely unrelated to the ESG metric in question, which concerns the disclosure of monetary losses due to legal proceedings associated with anti-competitive behaviour regulations. All segments pertain to technical research in artificial intelligence, specifically hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), causal inference, and agent-based modeling. The keyword matches (e.g., 'proceedings', 'with') are superficial and contextually irrelevant—'proceedings' refers to academic conference proceedings, not legal proceedings. The retrieval type is keyword-based with low match scores (ranging from 0.100 to 0.200), indicating weak relevance. No mention of legal, regulatory, financial loss, competition law, or ESG-related compliance is present. Therefore, there is no substantive or contextual evidence of disclosure for this metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P013_S038, P001_S010, P001_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document indexing by distinguishing homonyms (e.g., 'proceedings' in academic vs. legal contexts) to reduce false positives.
  - Incorporate semantic search models trained on ESG-specific terminology to better identify relevant content related to legal penalties and regulatory compliance.
  - Expand data sources to include annual reports, sustainability disclosures, legal filings, or regulatory notices where such financial losses would typically be reported.
  - Apply named entity recognition (NER) for legal and financial entities to enhance detection of relevant disclosures.

#### Number of (1) performance issues  (sasb_26_Number_of_1_performance_issues_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments contain keywords such as 'performance', 'number', and 'issues'—which partially match the metric name 'Number of (1) performance issues'—the context in which these terms appear is unrelated to ESG performance tracking or disclosure. The retrieved segments are drawn from a technical AI/ML research context, specifically discussing hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), subgoal discovery, and algorithmic performance in training agents. Terms like 'performance' refer to algorithmic or model performance (e.g., 'jumpstart performance' in transfer learning), not organizational ESG performance issues. Similarly, 'number' appears in reference to subgoal numbering or indexing within computational models, not counts of real-world operational or compliance issues. All segments were retrieved via keyword matching with low match scores (0.222), indicating weak relevance, and none were retrieved via semantic methods, suggesting a lack of conceptual alignment. There is no mention of metrics, reporting frameworks, data collection, or disclosures related to environmental, social, or governance performance issues. Therefore, there is no meaningful disclosure of the specified SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S014, P002_S008, P004_S016
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that documents submitted for ESG disclosure contain explicit references to performance issues in operational, environmental, or social contexts, particularly using standardized terminology aligned with SASB guidelines.
  - Improve metadata tagging and indexing of ESG reports to enhance semantic retrieval accuracy for compliance analysis.
  - Include quantitative disclosures with clear labels and units (e.g., 'Number of performance issues identified in supply chain audits: X') to facilitate accurate metric mapping.

#### (2) service disruptions (sasb_27_2_service_disruptions)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are exclusively focused on a technical artificial intelligence research topic—specifically, a human-guided causal inference method in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HCPI-HRL). While the term 'from' was used as a keyword match across all segments, leading to low match scores (0.143) and retrieval via keyword-based search, none of the content relates to service disruptions in an operational, organizational, or ESG context. There is no mention of service availability, outage events, incident management, downtime duration, impact on stakeholders, or any related performance indicators that would constitute disclosure for the SASB metric sasb_27_2_service_disruptions. The repeated references to 'from' appear in academic descriptions of model design and causal inference mechanisms, not in relation to service continuity or disruption reporting. Given the complete absence of relevant qualitative or quantitative information tied to service disruptions, the disclosure status is determined as 'none'.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P001_S014, P001_S015
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure document retrieval systems use semantic matching enhanced with domain-specific filters to avoid irrelevant technical AI/ML research papers being retrieved for ESG operational resilience metrics.
  - Verify that source documents include operational reports, sustainability disclosures, or IT/service management records where service disruption data would typically be reported.
  - Refine keyword indexing by excluding generic terms like 'from' unless paired with domain-relevant context to improve precision in future retrievals.

#### (3) total customer downtime (sasb_28_3_total_customer_downtime)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are centered around a technical AI research topic—specifically, a human-guided causal inference-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HCPI-HRL) method. While terms such as 'total rewards' and 'from' appear in some contexts, they are used within reinforcement learning formulations and do not relate to the ESG metric 'total customer downtime'. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with low match scores (highest being 0.222), indicating weak relevance. The matched keywords like 'total' and 'from' are generic and coincidental. None of the segments mention customer service, system reliability, outage events, or any operational data related to customer-facing service interruptions. There is no reference to performance metrics, service level agreements, or infrastructure uptime/downtime that would be necessary to disclose information on total customer downtime. Therefore, despite the presence of the word 'total' in one segment, there is no substantive or contextual evidence of disclosure for this ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S017, P001_S010, P001_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that disclosures for 'total customer downtime' include quantified data such as aggregate hours of service interruption experienced by customers over a reporting period.
  - Clearly define the scope of 'customer downtime' (e.g., by service line, region, or product) to improve transparency and comparability.
  - Include context such as root causes of downtime, mitigation measures taken, and trends compared to prior periods to enhance disclosure quality.
  - Use structured reporting aligned with SASB standards to ensure relevant operational resilience and customer service metrics are captured.

#### Description of business continuity risks related to disruptions of operations (sasb_29_Description_of_business_continuity_risks_related_t)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are entirely focused on a technical AI/ML method called HCPI-HRL (Human Causal Perception and Inference-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning), which relates to reinforcement learning, subgoal generation, and causal inference in dynamic environments. While the term 'description' appears in some segments and was likely responsible for keyword-based retrieval (e.g., 'description', 'from'), there is no substantive content related to business continuity risks or operational disruptions. The metric in question requires disclosure about risks to business operations from disruptions (e.g., natural disasters, cyberattacks, supply chain failures) and how the organization manages them. None of the segments mention business operations, risk management frameworks, continuity planning, or resilience strategies. Furthermore, all retrieval instances were based on low-scoring keyword matches (highest match score: 0.200), indicating weak relevance. The context is purely academic and algorithmic, not corporate ESG reporting or risk disclosure.
- **Evidence Segments**: P004_S012, P001_S010, P001_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval systems use semantic understanding in addition to keyword matching to avoid irrelevant technical papers being included in ESG compliance analysis.
  - Verify source document relevance before analysis—confirm that documents are from corporate sustainability reports, regulatory filings, or official company disclosures rather than research articles.
  - Refine search queries to include ESG-specific terminology such as 'business continuity plan', 'operational disruption risk', or 'resilience strategy' to improve precision.

#### (1) Number of licences or subscriptions (sasb_30_1_Number_of_licences_or_subscriptions)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although the term 'number' appears multiple times across the retrieved segments, all instances are contextually related to technical or algorithmic parameters in reinforcement learning environments (e.g., number of steps, number of frames, number of processes, number of obstacles). The metric in question—'Number of licences or subscriptions'—pertains to business operations or software usage rights, which is entirely unrelated to the content discussed in the segments. The keyword-based retrieval has resulted in low match scores (0.333) and no semantic relevance to licensing or subscription models. None of the segments mention any form of commercial product licensing, user subscriptions, software access rights, or related ESG compliance disclosures. Therefore, there is no meaningful disclosure related to this SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P002_S008, P004_S016, P006_S007
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure document corpus includes operational or financial reports that detail software licensing or subscription models.
  - Improve retrieval precision by incorporating semantic filters that distinguish between quantitative technical terms and business-related metrics.
  - Expand data sources to include product usage, customer agreements, or service provisioning documentation relevant to software access.

#### (2) percentage cloud-based (TC-SI-000.A)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: No relevant metric content found

#### (1) Data processing capacity (sasb_32_1_Data_processing_capacity)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments contain keywords such as 'data' and 'capacity', which partially match the metric name 'Data processing capacity', the context of all retrieved segments is focused on artificial intelligence, hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), subgoal discovery, and cognitive modeling. None of the segments provide any explicit or implicit information about an organization's data processing capacity in terms of infrastructure, computational throughput, data volume handled, system scalability, or related operational metrics. The term 'capacity' in Segment 1 refers to an agent’s exploration capacity in AI training, not data processing capability. Similarly, references to 'data' in Segments 2–5 are in the context of data-driven AI methods or sparse data inference, not organizational data handling or processing performance. All segments were retrieved via keyword matching with low match scores (0.333) and lack semantic relevance to ESG or technical infrastructure disclosures. There is no evidence of disclosure aligned with the SASB metric sasb_32_1_Data_processing_capacity, which typically pertains to a company's ability to manage and process data efficiently and securely within its IT systems.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S013, P001_S014, P002_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that disclosures for 'Data processing capacity' include quantitative or qualitative details on data ingestion rates, storage infrastructure, computational processing power, or system scalability.
  - Use precise terminology related to IT infrastructure and data operations to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance.
  - Align disclosures with SASB standards by addressing specific aspects such as data lifecycle management, processing efficiency, and technological capabilities.

#### (2) percentage outsourced (TC-SI-000.B)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: No relevant metric content found

#### (1) Amount of data storage (sasb_34_1_Amount_of_data_storage)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although the term 'data' appears frequently across all five retrieved segments, it is used exclusively in the context of general research methodology, machine learning, and cognitive science frameworks—specifically relating to data-driven hierarchical reinforcement learning, causal inference from sparse data, and Bayesian modeling. The matching keyword 'data' has a low match score (0.333) in each case, and the retrieval type is keyword-based rather than semantic, indicating weak relevance to the actual ESG metric in question. None of the segments mention 'data storage' as a physical or operational resource, nor do they quantify or describe the amount of data storage used, its environmental impact, infrastructure, or management practices. There is no reference to metrics, units (e.g., terabytes, petabytes), systems, or policies related to data storage capacity or efficiency. Therefore, despite superficial keyword matches, there is no substantive disclosure related to the SASB metric sasb_34_1_Amount_of_data_storage.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S014, P002_S008, P003_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve retrieval precision by enhancing semantic search capabilities to distinguish between contextual uses of 'data' and physical 'data storage' metrics.
  - Expand keyword taxonomy to include synonyms and units for data storage (e.g., 'storage capacity', 'TB', 'data center storage', 'digital storage volume').
  - Focus on technical or infrastructure-related documents (e.g., IT reports, sustainability disclosures, data center operations) where quantitative data storage metrics are more likely to be reported.

#### (2) percentage outsourced (TC-SI-000.C)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: No relevant metric content found
