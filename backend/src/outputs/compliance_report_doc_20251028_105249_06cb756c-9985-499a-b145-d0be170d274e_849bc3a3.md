## Detailed Analysis Results

### ❌ Not Disclosed

#### (1) Total energy consumed (sasb_0_1_Total_energy_consumed)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although the term 'total' appears multiple times across the retrieved segments (e.g., 'total number of operations', 'total number of triangles'), these references are strictly within a computational graph theory context, specifically discussing algorithmic work, clique enumeration, and parallel processing efficiency. The metric in question—'Total energy consumed'—relates to physical energy usage, typically measured in joules or kilowatt-hours, in organizational operations. None of the segments mention energy consumption, power usage, resource utilization in hardware, or any related environmental, operational, or ESG performance indicators. The keyword-based retrieval appears to have matched on the word 'total' as a linguistic overlap, but there is no semantic or contextual relevance to energy metrics. Furthermore, all content is theoretical computer science focused on algorithm design and complexity analysis, with no connection to sustainability reporting, corporate ESG disclosures, or energy accounting. Therefore, despite the presence of the keyword 'total', there is no actual disclosure related to the specified ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S007, P002_S003, P003_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve retrieval precision by filtering out algorithmic or mathematical uses of the term 'total' when analyzing ESG energy metrics.
  - Incorporate semantic context filters to distinguish between 'total' as a quantitative descriptor in technical algorithms versus 'total energy' as an environmental metric.
  - Expand keyword mapping to include synonyms and units for energy consumption (e.g., kWh, MWh, joules, electricity usage) to enhance recall for relevant disclosures.

#### (2) percentage grid electricity (TC-SI-130a.1)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: No relevant metric content found

#### (3) percentage renewable (TC-SI-130a.1)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: No relevant metric content found

#### (1) Total water withdrawn (sasb_3_1_Total_water_withdrawn)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although the term 'total' appears multiple times across the retrieved segments (with low match scores of 0.143 and all via keyword retrieval), the context is entirely unrelated to environmental, social, or governance (ESG) metrics. The documents discuss theoretical computer science concepts, specifically parallel algorithms for graph nucleus decomposition and clique enumeration. Instances of 'total' refer to computational elements such as 'total number of operations', 'total sum over all k-cliques', or 'total number of triangles' in a graph, which are algorithmic measures, not water withdrawal data. There is no mention of water usage, resource management, environmental impact, or any related ESG disclosure. The retrieval type being keyword-based with low match scores further indicates weak relevance. No quantitative or qualitative disclosures related to 'Total water withdrawn' (SASB Code sasb_3_1_Total_water_withdrawn) are present in any segment.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S007, P002_S003, P003_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that ESG reporting systems are integrated with relevant operational data sources to capture actual water withdrawal metrics.
  - Improve document tagging and retrieval mechanisms by using domain-specific ontologies to reduce false positives from irrelevant technical literature.
  - Conduct regular audits of ESG data collection processes to verify completeness and accuracy of disclosed metrics, especially for SASB-aligned indicators.

#### (2) total water consumed (sasb_4_2_total_water_consumed)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although the term 'total' appears multiple times across the retrieved segments (with a consistent but low match score of 0.143 and retrieval type 'keyword'), these occurrences are strictly within a computational graph theory context, specifically discussing the total number of cliques (e.g., '14 total triangles') in algorithmic examples. The metric in question—'total water consumed'—is an environmental sustainability indicator related to resource usage, particularly relevant in ESG reporting for industrial or operational activities. None of the provided segments mention water, consumption, utilities, environmental impact, or any related terms. The keyword 'total' is generic and its presence alone does not imply disclosure of the specified ESG metric. Furthermore, all content is focused on theoretical computer science, parallel algorithms, and graph decomposition, with no connection to corporate sustainability, operations data, or environmental disclosures. Therefore, there is no meaningful or contextual disclosure of the metric 'total water consumed'.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S007, P002_S003, P003_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that ESG reports include dedicated sections for environmental metrics such as water consumption, clearly labeled and quantified.
  - Use precise terminology like 'water consumption', 'total water use', or 'water withdrawn/used' to improve keyword relevance and retrieval accuracy.
  - Include numerical data with units (e.g., cubic meters or gallons) and time periods (e.g., fiscal year 2023) to enhance disclosure quality.
  - Avoid overloading generic terms like 'total' without contextual linkage to specific resources to prevent misclassification during information retrieval.

#### (3) percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress (sasb_5_3_percentage_of_each_in_regions_with_High_or_Ext)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily technical descriptions related to parallel graph algorithms, clique counting, and nucleus decomposition in computational graph theory. While the metric name refers to 'percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress'—an environmental (E) ESG metric related to water stress exposure—the content across all segments does not mention water stress, geographic regions, environmental impact, resource usage, or any ESG-related data. The matching keywords such as 'high', 'with', 'each', and 'regions' appear to have triggered retrieval based on superficial lexical overlap rather than semantic relevance. All segments originate from a computer science context involving algorithmic performance, data structures, and graph theory, with no indication of corporate sustainability reporting or environmental disclosures. The retrieval type is keyword-based with low match scores (0.300 and 0.200), further indicating weak relevance. There is no evidence of disclosure for the specified ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S003, P003_S007, P004_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve retrieval precision by combining keyword matching with domain-specific semantic filtering to exclude irrelevant technical domains (e.g., computer science algorithms) when analyzing ESG metrics.
  - Verify the contextual relevance of matched terms, especially for commonly used words like 'high', 'each', and 'regions', which may appear frequently across unrelated domains.
  - Incorporate metadata tagging to distinguish between ESG reports and non-ESG technical documents during document ingestion.
  - Consider expanding the search to include sustainability reports, CSR disclosures, or CDP responses where water stress metrics are more likely to be reported.

#### Discussion of the integration of environmental considerations into strategic planning for data centre needs (sasb_6_Discussion_of_the_integration_of_environmental_con)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are derived solely through keyword matching (with low match scores of 0.100–0.200) based on terms such as 'data' and 'into', which appear in technical algorithmic contexts unrelated to environmental considerations or strategic planning for data centres. The content of all segments revolves around parallel hash tables, memory optimization, and clique computation in graph algorithms—topics that are purely computational and focused on data structure efficiency in high-performance computing. There is no mention of environmental integration, sustainability strategies, data centre infrastructure planning, or ESG-related policies. Furthermore, the retrieval type is keyword-based with minimal relevance, indicating weak contextual alignment with the target metric. No semantic matches were found, reinforcing the absence of meaningful disclosure.
- **Evidence Segments**: P008_S003, P009_S001, P009_S004
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide explicit discussion on how environmental factors (e.g., energy efficiency, carbon footprint, water usage) are incorporated into the strategic planning of data centre operations and infrastructure development.
  - Include qualitative or quantitative disclosures on sustainability goals, climate risk assessments, or green design principles applied to data centre expansion or management.
  - Enhance document indexing and metadata to improve semantic retrieval accuracy for ESG-related queries by tagging relevant policy statements or strategic initiatives.

#### Description of policies and practices relating to targeted advertising and user privacy (sasb_7_Description_of_policies_and_practices_relating_to_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily focused on graph algorithms, clique decomposition, and parallel computing techniques, with no meaningful discussion of policies or practices related to targeted advertising or user privacy. Although the term 'data' appears in the matched keywords across several segments, it refers exclusively to computational data structures, algorithmic inputs, or research artifacts (e.g., source code and datasets for graph analysis), not personal data handling, privacy policies, or advertising practices. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with low match scores (0.100–0.200), indicating weak relevance to the intended metric. Furthermore, there is no semantic indication of ESG-related content, regulatory compliance, data protection, or user consent mechanisms. The context is purely technical and rooted in computer science research, specifically algorithm design for graph theory, which is unrelated to the ESG disclosure requirement for user privacy and targeted advertising governance.
- **Evidence Segments**: P004_S008, P014_S005, P001_S007
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that documentation or reports include dedicated sections outlining data privacy policies, user consent mechanisms, and advertising practices.
  - Improve metadata tagging and indexing to distinguish between technical 'data' (e.g., datasets, algorithm inputs) and personal/user data processing activities relevant to ESG reporting.
  - Incorporate semantic search capabilities to better capture contextually relevant disclosures even when exact keywords are absent.
  - Provide explicit descriptions of how user data is collected, used, shared, and protected, particularly in relation to advertising technologies and tracking mechanisms.

#### Number of users whose information is used for secondary purposes (sasb_8_Number_of_users_whose_information_is_used_for_seco)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are primarily technical descriptions of parallel graph algorithms, data structures (e.g., hash tables, bucketing), and computational complexity analysis. While terms such as 'number', 'data', and 'used' appear in the text—triggering keyword-based retrieval with low match scores (0.300 and 0.200)—these references pertain to algorithmic operations (e.g., counting cliques, managing data structures) rather than any disclosure related to user data usage. The metric 'Number of users whose information is used for secondary purposes' pertains to privacy, data governance, and ethical use of personal information in an ESG context. None of the segments address user data, consent, secondary use, or privacy policies. The tag information confirms that matches were based on generic keywords with minimal relevance to the intended ESG metric. There is no mention of users, personal information, data processing activities, or compliance frameworks. Therefore, there is no meaningful disclosure related to this ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S003, P009_S004, P014_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Include explicit disclosures about user data handling practices, particularly regarding secondary uses such as analytics, advertising, or sharing with third parties.
  - Report the number of users affected by secondary data processing, segmented by region or consent status, to improve transparency.
  - Reference relevant data protection standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and internal data governance policies in future reports to strengthen ESG compliance credibility.

#### Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with user privacy (sasb_9_Total_amount_of_monetary_losses_as_a_result_of_leg)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily technical descriptions related to parallel algorithms, graph theory, and data structures—specifically focusing on clique enumeration, nucleus decomposition, hash tables, and computational complexity. While terms such as 'total', 'amount', 'data', 'associated with', and 'result' appear in the text, they are used in a computational and algorithmic context (e.g., total work, amount of space, result of computation), not in relation to legal proceedings or financial losses tied to user privacy. The matching keywords stem from generic term overlaps rather than contextual relevance to the ESG metric. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based, with match scores ranging from 0.300 to 0.500, indicating only partial and superficial lexical overlap without semantic alignment. There is no mention of legal proceedings, user privacy violations, monetary losses, fines, settlements, or any related regulatory or compliance events. Therefore, there is no evidence of disclosure for the specified ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S003, P001_S007, P009_S001
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve specificity in document tagging by distinguishing between technical/algorithmic usage of terms like 'total amount' and financial/legal contexts.
  - Incorporate semantic analysis to filter out irrelevant technical content when retrieving ESG-related disclosures.
  - Expand keyword lists to include domain-specific legal and compliance terminology such as 'fines', 'privacy litigation', 'regulatory penalty', or 'data breach settlement' to enhance retrieval accuracy for this metric.

#### (1) Number of law enforcement requests for user information (sasb_10_1_Number_of_law_enforcement_requests_for_user_in)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily technical descriptions of parallel graph algorithms, focusing on clique counting, truss decomposition, and related computational methods. While the term 'number' appears frequently in the context of algorithmic operations (e.g., number of cliques, s-clique counts), and 'user' is mentioned once in a generic function description ('user-specified function f'), there is no reference to law enforcement requests for user information or any related metric reporting. The metric in question—'Number of law enforcement requests for user information'—is a transparency and privacy disclosure commonly reported by technology companies in their ESG or human rights reports. However, all segments here originate from academic computer science literature focused on graph theory and parallel computing, with retrieval based on low-scoring keyword matches (maximum match score 0.300, below typical relevance thresholds). The presence of keywords like 'data', 'number', and 'user' appears coincidental and contextually unrelated to ESG compliance or legal request disclosures. There is no evidence of organizational policy, legal compliance reporting, or data governance practices related to user data requests.
- **Evidence Segments**: P014_S005, P003_S003, P003_S007
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure retrieval system uses semantic matching tuned for ESG-specific contexts, rather than general keyword overlap which may retrieve irrelevant technical literature.
  - Expand document corpus to include corporate sustainability reports, transparency reports, or legal compliance disclosures where such metrics are typically published.
  - Refine search queries to include phrases such as 'law enforcement requests', 'government data requests', or 'transparency report statistics' to improve precision.

#### (2) number of users whose information was requested (sasb_11_2_number_of_users_whose_information_was_requeste)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily technical descriptions related to parallel graph algorithms, clique counting, and data structures such as hash tables and bucketing mechanisms. While the keyword 'number' appears frequently across segments (in contexts like 'number of cliques' or 'count'), and the term 'whose' is present in Segment 5, these references pertain to algorithmic operations on graph data structures—not user data or information requests. The metric '(2) number of users whose information was requested' pertains to privacy, data governance, or legal compliance disclosures (e.g., government data requests), which are entirely absent from the provided content. All segments originate from computer science research papers focused on theoretical and practical aspects of graph processing, with no mention of user privacy, data access logs, legal disclosures, or similar ESG-related compliance topics. The tag information confirms that retrieval was based on low-scoring keyword matches (e.g., 'data', 'number', 'whose') rather than semantic relevance to the metric’s intended meaning. Therefore, there is no substantive disclosure related to the specified metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P014_S005, P003_S003, P004_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that future document retrieval incorporates semantic understanding to filter out irrelevant technical algorithmic content when analyzing ESG compliance metrics.
  - Include sources such as corporate sustainability reports, privacy policies, or transparency reports (e.g., Google Transparency Report, Apple Privacy Report) where actual disclosures about user data requests would be expected.
  - Refine search queries to include context-specific terms like 'user data request', 'government data access', 'information disclosure', or 'transparency report' to improve relevance.

####  (3) percentage resulting in disclosure (sasb_12__3_percentage_resulting_in_disclosure)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily technical research content related to graph algorithms, parallel computing, and data structures, with a focus on clique enumeration, nucleus decomposition, and efficient computational methods. While the term 'data' appears in multiple tag information fields and is mentioned in the context of algorithmic processing, storage, and availability (e.g., GitHub repository for artifacts), there is no direct or indirect mention of the specific ESG metric 'percentage resulting in disclosure' (SASB code: sasb_12__3_percentage_resulting_in_disclosure). The segments do not contain any quantitative disclosures, percentages, or contextual information regarding corporate sustainability reporting, compliance rates, or disclosure outcomes that would be relevant to this SASB metric. The keyword-based retrieval yielded low match scores (maximum 0.286), indicating weak relevance, and no semantic alignment with ESG or disclosure metrics was evident. Therefore, despite the presence of 'data' as a matched keyword, the content does not pertain to ESG disclosure practices or performance metrics.
- **Evidence Segments**: P014_S005, P001_S007, P001_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that documents submitted for ESG analysis include explicit references to SASB metrics or disclosure percentages.
  - Improve retrieval precision by incorporating domain-specific filters to exclude purely technical computer science research when analyzing ESG compliance.
  - Verify that source materials contain actual sustainability reports or corporate disclosures rather than academic algorithmic studies.

#### List of countries where core products or services are subject to government-required monitoring, blocking, content filtering, or censoring (sasb_13_List_of_countries_where_core_products_or_services_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are entirely technical in nature, focusing on parallel algorithms for graph theory problems such as clique enumeration and nucleus decomposition. While the keyword 'list' appears frequently, it refers to data structures (e.g., list buffers, adjacency lists) rather than any geopolitical or compliance-related listing of countries. The term 'content' is used in the context of data content within computational processes, not in reference to government-mandated content filtering or censorship. All segments originate from a computer science research paper on algorithmic efficiency and have no relation to ESG compliance, corporate governance, or digital rights. The retrieval was likely triggered by superficial keyword matches (e.g., 'list', 'data', 'content'), but the semantic context is completely unrelated to the intended metric. There is no mention of countries, government regulations, monitoring, blocking, or censoring of products or services. The low match scores (0.300 and below) and keyword-based retrieval type further indicate weak relevance. Therefore, there is no actual disclosure related to the specified metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S007, P009_S001, P009_S004
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document filtering to exclude purely technical algorithmic research papers when analyzing ESG compliance metrics.
  - Enhance retrieval precision by incorporating semantic context understanding to distinguish between technical usage of terms like 'list' and 'content' versus compliance-related meanings.
  - Cross-reference potential matches with entity names, country lists, regulatory terminology, or policy-related keywords to improve relevance for human rights and digital freedom metrics.

#### (1) Number of data breaches (sasb_14_1_Number_of_data_breaches)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily technical academic content focused on graph algorithms, parallel computing, and data structures—specifically discussing concepts such as k-cliques, trusses, hash tables, and bucketing in the context of algorithm design and performance optimization. While the keyword 'number' appears frequently (e.g., 'number of r-cliques', 'number of s-cliques'), it refers to computational graph theory metrics rather than organizational ESG or cybersecurity incidents. The term 'data' is used in the context of data structures and processing, not data security or breach events. Although Segment 1 includes a tag with the keyword 'security' and a relatively high match score (0.750), the actual content does not discuss data breaches, cybersecurity incidents, or any related organizational disclosures. None of the segments report actual figures, trends, or qualitative descriptions related to the number of data breaches experienced by an organization. The retrieval type across all segments is keyword-based, with moderate to low match scores (except Segment 1), indicating weak semantic relevance to the intended ESG metric. Overall, there is no evidence of disclosure for the metric 'Number of data breaches'.
- **Evidence Segments**: P014_S005, P003_S003, P004_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document indexing by distinguishing between technical algorithmic terminology (e.g., 'number of cliques') and ESG-related metrics (e.g., 'number of data breaches') to reduce false keyword matches.
  - Incorporate semantic search capabilities to better identify context-specific usage of terms like 'data' and 'number' in ESG reporting contexts.
  - Expand data sources to include official ESG reports, corporate sustainability disclosures, or cybersecurity incident logs where actual breach data would be formally reported.

#### (2) percentage that are personal data breaches (sasb_15_2_percentage_that_are_personal_data_breaches)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are derived solely through keyword matching (with low match scores of 0.333) based on common words such as 'that' and 'data', which appear frequently in academic and technical writing. None of the segments pertain to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) topics, data privacy, or personal data breaches. Instead, they originate from a computer science research paper focused on parallel algorithms for graph theory problems, specifically (r,s)-nucleus decomposition and k-clique enumeration. There is no mention of personal data, data breach incidents, percentages, risk management, cybersecurity policies, or any related metrics that would indicate disclosure of the SASB metric 'sasb_15_2_percentage_that_are_personal_data_breaches'. The content is entirely technical and algorithmic, with no relevance to corporate ESG reporting or data protection compliance. Therefore, despite the presence of the word 'data' in context, there is no actual disclosure of the requested ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S007, P001_S012, P003_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure retrieval system filters out irrelevant technical or scientific papers when analyzing ESG disclosures by improving semantic understanding and domain filtering.
  - Use more precise keyword sets or contextual embeddings specific to data privacy and cybersecurity incidents to improve relevance in future searches.
  - Cross-reference with known ESG reporting frameworks and terminology to distinguish between generic use of terms like 'data' and actual ESG-related disclosures.

#### (3) number of users affected (sasb_16_3_number_of_users_affected)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily technical descriptions of parallel graph algorithms, focusing on clique counting, k-truss decomposition, and related computational methods. While terms such as 'number', 'data', and 'count' appear frequently—explaining why keyword-based retrieval yielded matches with moderate scores (0.400–0.600)—these references pertain to algorithmic operations (e.g., counting cliques or managing data structures), not ESG-related disclosures. The metric 'number of users affected' is an ESG impact indicator, typically requiring disclosure of real-world user impacts related to privacy breaches, service disruptions, or product risks. None of the segments mention users, incidents affecting users, or any social impact metrics. The context is purely computer science research, specifically high-performance graph processing, with no connection to corporate ESG reporting, stakeholder impacts, or sustainability disclosures. Therefore, despite superficial keyword overlaps, there is no substantive or contextual evidence of disclosure for this ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P014_S005, P003_S003, P004_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure retrieval systems prioritize semantic relevance over keyword matching when analyzing ESG disclosure content to reduce false positives from technically similar but contextually unrelated texts.
  - Expand data sources to include corporate sustainability reports, ESG filings, press releases, or incident disclosure statements where user impact metrics are more likely to be reported.
  - Apply domain filtering to exclude purely academic or algorithmic research papers when assessing ESG compliance metrics unless explicitly linked to real-world social impact reporting.

#### Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security risks, including use of third-party cybersecurity standards (sasb_17_Description_of_approach_to_identifying_and_address)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are derived exclusively through keyword-based matching with low to moderate match scores (0.200–0.300), and the content is highly technical, focusing on graph theory, clique decomposition algorithms, and parallel computing methods. While terms such as 'data', 'description', 'approach', 'identifying', and 'use' appear in the segments, they occur in a mathematical and algorithmic context unrelated to data security risk management or cybersecurity standards. There is no mention of data security risks, risk identification processes, mitigation strategies, or adoption of third-party cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2). The 'approach' referenced in the text pertains to computational graph decomposition techniques, not organizational risk assessment methodologies. Furthermore, none of the segments contain narrative descriptions typical of ESG disclosures, such as policies, governance structures, audit practices, or compliance measures related to cybersecurity. As such, the information fails to address the substance of the SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P004_S008, P015_S001, P001_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Include a clear narrative description of the organization's process for identifying data security risks, including threat modeling, vulnerability assessments, and risk prioritization methodologies.
  - Describe how the organization addresses identified data security risks through technical controls, employee training, incident response planning, and continuous monitoring.
  - Explicitly reference the use of recognized third-party cybersecurity standards or frameworks (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO/IEC 27001, CIS Controls) and explain how they are integrated into the organization’s security program.
  - Ensure future disclosures are contextually relevant to ESG and avoid technical content that may trigger false-positive retrievals from non-applicable domains such as theoretical computer science.

#### Percentage of employees that require a work visa (sasb_18_Percentage_of_employees_that_require_a_work_visa)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are entirely technical and academic in nature, focusing on graph theory, clique enumeration, and parallel algorithms for nucleus decomposition in computational graph mining. While the keyword matches include terms such as 'that', 'require', 'work', and 'global', these are generic words that coincidentally align with the metric name but do not relate to workforce composition or visa status of employees. The context of 'work' in the segments refers to computational work or algorithmic effort, not employment or labor. None of the segments mention employee demographics, immigration status, visa requirements, or human resource data. The retrieval type is primarily keyword-based with low match scores (0.300–0.400), indicating weak relevance. There is no semantic connection between the content and the ESG metric in question. Therefore, there is no meaningful disclosure related to the percentage of employees requiring a work visa.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P013_S030, P001_S004
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document indexing by distinguishing between homonyms (e.g., 'work' as labor vs. computational work) to reduce false keyword matches.
  - Incorporate domain-specific filters to exclude irrelevant technical or scientific literature when retrieving ESG-related HR metrics.
  - Use more precise semantic search models trained on ESG reporting terminology to enhance retrieval accuracy.
  - Expand data sources to include official ESG reports, human resources disclosures, or regulatory filings where workforce visa information is more likely to be reported.

#### Employee engagement as a percentage (sasb_19_Employee_engagement_as_a_percentage)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are entirely focused on the computational and algorithmic aspects of nucleus decomposition in graph mining, particularly discussing performance comparisons, speedups, parallelization strategies, and memory usage of various implementations (e.g., arb-nucleus-decomp, pnd, and-nn). While terms such as 'global' appear in the context of 'global peeling-based model', they refer to algorithmic paradigms in graph processing and not to any organizational or geographic scope related to employee engagement. The metric 'Employee engagement as a percentage' (sasb_19_Employee_engagement_as_a_percentage) is an ESG-related human capital management indicator, requiring disclosure of workforce sentiment or survey results. None of the segments contain any information related to employee surveys, engagement rates, workforce demographics, or corporate social responsibility practices. The high match scores (0.111) are based on keyword retrieval of 'global', which is semantically unrelated to the ESG metric context. Therefore, there is no relevant disclosure present.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P013_S030, P013_S032
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval systems are tuned to distinguish between homonymous technical terms (e.g., 'global' in algorithms vs. 'global' in organizational scope).
  - Expand search queries to include synonyms and ESG-specific terminology such as 'employee satisfaction', 'engagement rate', 'workforce survey', or 'SASB employee metrics'.
  - Incorporate semantic filtering to exclude technically unrelated domains (e.g., graph theory, computer science algorithms) when analyzing ESG compliance topics.

#### Percentage of (1) gender (sasb_20_Percentage_of_1_gender)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are entirely technical and focused on graph mining algorithms, specifically the (r,s) nucleus decomposition problem in large-scale networks. While terms like 'global' appear in the text and were likely responsible for the keyword-based retrieval (with low match scores of 0.125), they are used in a computational and structural context—referring to global peeling-based models in algorithm design—not in relation to organizational, environmental, social, or governance (ESG) disclosures. There is no mention of gender diversity metrics, workforce composition, inclusion initiatives, or any data related to the percentage of gender representation in an organization. The metric 'sasb_20_Percentage_of_1_gender' pertains to SASB standards for human capital disclosure, particularly gender breakdowns in the workforce, but none of the provided content addresses this topic. All segments discuss algorithmic performance, speedups, parallelism, and clique enumeration in graphs, indicating a complete misalignment with the intended ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P013_S030, P013_S032
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval systems are calibrated to distinguish between homonymous technical terms (e.g., 'global' in algorithms vs. 'global' operations in ESG reporting).
  - Incorporate semantic filtering to exclude domains clearly unrelated to sustainability or corporate governance (e.g., graph theory papers) when analyzing ESG disclosure content.
  - Expand data sources to include corporate sustainability reports, ESG filings, or HR diversity disclosures where gender percentage metrics are more likely to be reported.
  - Use additional validation layers such as named entity recognition or domain classification to improve relevance of retrieved segments for ESG metrics.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (a) executive management (sasb_21_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are entirely technical and focused on graph mining algorithms, specifically nucleus decomposition in large-scale graphs, parallel hash tables, clique enumeration, and performance optimization in computational systems. While keywords such as 'global', 'group', and 'representation' appear in the text, they are used in a computational and mathematical context (e.g., 'global peeling-based model', 'r-clique representation', 'parallel bucketing structure') rather than in relation to workforce diversity, executive management, or ESG reporting. The tag information confirms that matches were based on keyword retrieval with low match scores (0.100), indicating weak relevance. No segment mentions any aspect of organizational diversity metrics, demographic data, executive leadership composition, or ESG/SASB disclosure practices. Therefore, there is no meaningful disclosure related to the specified metric on the percentage of two diversity groups in executive management.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P003_S003, P008_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that ESG-related queries are supported by domain-specific document collections containing sustainability reports, corporate disclosures, or SASB implementation guides.
  - Improve retrieval precision by combining keyword filtering with semantic similarity models trained on ESG terminology to reduce noise from irrelevant technical literature.
  - Include metadata tagging for document domains (e.g., computer science vs. corporate governance) to filter out off-topic segments during analysis.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (b) non-executive management (sasb_22_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are entirely technical and academic in nature, focusing on graph theory, parallel algorithms, and computational methods for nucleus decomposition in large graphs. While the keywords 'global', 'group', and 'representation' appear in the text—matching parts of the metric name—they are used in a mathematical and algorithmic context (e.g., 'global peeling-based model', 'r-clique representation', 'grouping r-cliques') rather than in relation to workforce diversity or organizational demographics. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with low match scores (0.100), indicating weak relevance. There is no mention of non-executive management, diversity groups (such as gender, race, ethnicity), or any human resource data. None of the content addresses ESG, corporate social responsibility, or workforce composition metrics. As such, there is no evidence of disclosure related to the specified SASB metric on diversity group representation in non-executive management.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P003_S003, P008_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that future document retrieval includes sources from sustainability reports, ESG disclosures, or human capital management sections where workforce diversity data is typically reported.
  - Refine search queries to include explicit ESG-related synonyms such as 'workforce diversity', 'management inclusion', 'demographic breakdown', or 'non-executive leadership composition' to avoid irrelevant technical academic literature.
  - Apply semantic filtering to exclude domains like computer science, mathematics, or engineering when analyzing ESG human capital metrics unless contextual disambiguation is applied.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (c) technical employees (sasb_23_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are highly technical and focused on graph theory, parallel algorithms, and computational methods for nucleus decomposition in large graphs. While keywords such as 'global', 'group', and 'representation' appear in the text and were likely responsible for retrieval due to keyword-based matching with a low match score (0.100 across all segments), these terms are used in a purely algorithmic and mathematical context—referring to data structures, clique groupings, or memory representations—not in relation to workforce diversity, employee demographics, or human resource composition. There is no mention of technical employees, diversity groups (such as gender, race, or ethnicity), or any metrics related to workforce inclusion. The term 'representation' appears in the context of data indexing and hash table structures, not social or organizational representation. All segments originate from what appears to be a computer science paper on parallel graph processing, with no connection to ESG reporting, corporate sustainability, or diversity disclosures. Given that none of the content addresses the metric's intent—measuring diversity among technical staff—the disclosure is absent.
- **Evidence Segments**: P001_S010, P003_S003, P008_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval systems use semantic filtering to reduce false positives from technically homonymous terms (e.g., 'group', 'representation') when analyzing ESG metrics.
  - Cross-reference keyword matches with domain-specific context to exclude irrelevant technical literature from ESG compliance analyses.
  - Seek explicit human capital reports, DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) disclosures, or workforce composition tables in official company filings (e.g., 10-K, sustainability reports) for accurate assessment of this SASB metric.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (d) all other employees (sasb_24_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments are derived from a technical computer science paper focused on parallel algorithms for graph processing, specifically nucleus decomposition, clique counting, and related data structures such as parallel hash tables and bucketing structures. While the keyword matches include terms like 'all', 'other', and 'representation', these occur in purely algorithmic and computational contexts (e.g., 'all vertices', 'other configurations', 'representation of vertices in hash tables') and are unrelated to workforce diversity or employee demographics. The retrieval type is keyword-based with low match scores (0.300 and 0.200), indicating weak relevance. No segment mentions human resources, employee composition, diversity groups (such as gender, race, ethnicity), or any ESG-related reporting metrics. There is no reference to organizational workforce structure, inclusion initiatives, or representation percentages for any demographic group among employees. Therefore, despite superficial keyword overlaps, there is no substantive disclosure related to the ESG metric 'Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (d) all other employees'.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S003, P010_S002, P002_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that future document retrieval uses more precise semantic filtering to distinguish between technical algorithmic terminology and ESG-related human capital management terms.
  - Expand data sources to include official ESG reports, sustainability disclosures, or diversity & inclusion reports where such metrics are typically published.
  - Use contextual disambiguation to filter out false positives arising from homonymous terms in non-ESG domains (e.g., 'representation' in data structures vs. workforce representation).

#### Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with anti-competitive behaviour regulations (sasb_25_Total_amount_of_monetary_losses_as_a_result_of_leg)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily technical and theoretical discussions related to parallel graph algorithms, clique enumeration, and computational complexity. While the keywords 'total', 'amount', 'result', and 'associated' appear in some segments, these matches are superficial and contextually unrelated to the ESG metric in question. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with low match scores (ranging from 0.200 to 0.300), indicating weak relevance. None of the segments mention legal proceedings, anti-competitive behavior, monetary losses, regulatory fines, or any financial or compliance-related disclosures. The term 'total amount of monetary losses' and its contextual elements are entirely absent. The content is rooted in computer science research on graph theory and algorithmic efficiency, not corporate governance, legal compliance, or financial risk reporting. Therefore, there is no meaningful disclosure of the specified ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S003, P001_S007, P002_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve keyword filtering by incorporating semantic analysis to reduce false positives from technically similar but contextually irrelevant content.
  - Expand data sources to include corporate sustainability reports, legal disclosures, or regulatory filings where such ESG metrics are more likely to be reported.
  - Use domain-specific NLP models trained on ESG reporting standards to better distinguish between relevant financial/compliance disclosures and irrelevant technical terminology.

#### Number of (1) performance issues  (sasb_26_Number_of_1_performance_issues_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention the word 'number' and some reference performance-related terms (e.g., speedups, work, rounds, clique counts), none of them directly disclose or quantify the specific metric 'Number of (1) performance issues'. The retrieved segments are primarily technical descriptions of parallel algorithms, optimizations, and performance benchmarks in graph processing, particularly related to (r,s)-nucleus decomposition. While Segment 4 references the 'number of rounds' and 'number of times s-cliques were discovered', these are algorithmic metrics rather than organizational or operational performance issues in an ESG context. The keyword-based retrieval (all with low match scores of 0.333 or 0.222) indicates weak relevance, and no semantic evidence suggests that the document addresses ESG performance issues, compliance incidents, or related disclosures. Therefore, there is no substantive disclosure of the intended ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S003, P009_S007, P010_S002
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that ESG reports explicitly define and quantify 'performance issues' in a non-technical, governance or operational context (e.g., number of compliance violations, failed audits, or sustainability target misses).
  - Use clear, standardized language aligned with SASB or other ESG frameworks when disclosing metrics to improve retrieval accuracy and transparency.
  - Include dedicated sections for quantitative ESG performance indicators with labeled data points to facilitate compliance analysis.

#### (2) service disruptions (sasb_27_2_service_disruptions)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are entirely technical and algorithmic in nature, focusing on parallel computing methods for clique counting and graph decomposition (e.g., (r,s)-nucleus decomposition, parallel hash tables, bucketing structures, and O(α)-orientations). While terms like 'service', 'disruptions', or related operational continuity concepts might loosely connect to system reliability in a broad IT context, there is no mention of service disruptions in the operational, business, or customer-impacting sense required by ESG frameworks such as SASB's metric sasb_27_2_service_disruptions. The keyword 'from' was used for retrieval, and all segments have low match scores (0.143), indicating weak relevance. Furthermore, the retrieval type is keyword-based, not semantic, suggesting these results were captured due to superficial keyword overlap (e.g., 'from' appearing in code comments or procedural descriptions), not meaningful content alignment. No data regarding frequency, duration, causes, impacts, or management of service disruptions is present.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S003, P003_S007, P004_S010
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that source documents include operational risk or service reliability reports where service disruption events would be formally recorded.
  - Use semantic search methods with domain-specific embeddings to improve retrieval accuracy for ESG metrics, reducing false positives from technically similar but contextually irrelevant content.
  - Incorporate additional keywords related to 'downtime', 'outage', 'service interruption', 'incident reporting', or 'availability' when retrieving information for this metric.

#### (3) total customer downtime (sasb_28_3_total_customer_downtime)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although the term 'total' appears multiple times across the retrieved segments (e.g., 'total number of triangles', 'total work', 'total subtraction'), these usages are strictly within a computational and algorithmic context related to clique counting in graph theory. The metric in question, 'sasb_28_3_total_customer_downtime', pertains to customer service reliability and operational performance in an ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) framework—specifically under social or service quality disclosures. None of the segments reference customer downtime, service interruptions, outage durations, or any related operational metrics. The keyword matches are based solely on the word 'total', which has a low match score (0.222) and is not semantically related to the intended metric. All retrieval types are keyword-based with identical low scores, indicating weak relevance. There is no evidence of disclosure regarding actual customer downtime data, measurement methodology, or performance trends.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S003, P005_S001, P005_S002
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that disclosures for 'total customer downtime' include explicit quantitative data such as total hours/duration of service outages experienced by customers over a reporting period.
  - Clearly define the scope and calculation methodology for 'total customer downtime' to align with SASB standards, including system boundaries, inclusion criteria, and monitoring practices.
  - Improve document indexing and metadata tagging to reduce false positives from irrelevant technical content when retrieving ESG-related disclosures.

#### Description of business continuity risks related to disruptions of operations (sasb_29_Description_of_business_continuity_risks_related_t)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention the term 'operations' and are retrieved based on keyword matching (with low match scores of 0.200 and 0.100), none of the content actually addresses the metric 'Description of business continuity risks related to disruptions of operations' as defined by SASB. The context in all retrieved segments is strictly computational and algorithmic, focusing on parallel computing operations, graph algorithms, work-span models, and data structures such as hash tables and bucketing systems. Terms like 'operations' refer to computational steps or algorithmic processes, not business operations or organizational risk management. There is no discussion of business continuity planning, operational disruptions due to external events (e.g., natural disasters, supply chain failures, cyberattacks), risk assessment methodologies, mitigation strategies, or resilience frameworks. The retrieval appears to be based on superficial keyword overlap rather than semantic relevance. Therefore, despite the presence of the word 'operations', there is no meaningful disclosure related to the intended ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S003, P006_S006, P009_S007
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that document retrieval for ESG metrics uses semantic analysis rather than pure keyword matching to avoid irrelevant technical content being surfaced.
  - Include explicit discussion of business continuity management systems, risk identification processes for operational disruptions, and examples of past incidents or preparedness measures to meet this metric's requirements.
  - Map disclosures to recognized standards such as ISO 22301, NIST, or other business continuity frameworks to enhance credibility and completeness.

#### (1) Number of licences or subscriptions (sasb_30_1_Number_of_licences_or_subscriptions)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although the term 'number' appears multiple times across the retrieved segments, all occurrences are in a purely algorithmic and mathematical context related to graph theory, clique counting, and parallel computation. The metric in question—'Number of licences or subscriptions'—is an ESG-related operational or compliance disclosure item typically associated with software usage, intellectual property, or service access rights. None of the segments refer to licences, subscriptions, software compliance, or any business operations context. The keyword matches are based solely on the word 'number', which is generic and used here in reference to computational counts (e.g., number of cliques, s-clique counts, etc.), not organizational assets or legal entitlements. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with low match scores (0.333), indicating weak relevance. There is no semantic alignment with the intended meaning of the metric. Therefore, despite the presence of the keyword, there is no actual disclosure of the specified ESG metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P002_S003, P003_S003, P003_S007
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Improve document indexing by distinguishing between numerical quantities in technical/mathematical contexts versus business/operational metrics.
  - Use more precise semantic tagging to avoid false positives from generic terms like 'number'.
  - Include contextual filters to ensure that ESG metric analysis only considers content related to organizational operations, compliance, licensing, or software governance.

#### (2) percentage cloud-based (TC-SI-000.A)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: No relevant metric content found

#### (1) Data processing capacity (sasb_32_1_Data_processing_capacity)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments contain the keyword 'data' and one segment mentions 'processing', these occurrences are contextually unrelated to the ESG metric 'Data processing capacity'. The retrieved segments are academic research excerpts focused on graph algorithms, parallel computing, and data structures—specifically discussing topics like k-core decomposition, nucleus decomposition, and parallel hash tables. The term 'data' appears in contexts such as data availability for research artifacts or data associated with algorithmic structures, not in relation to organizational data processing infrastructure, capacity, throughput, or scalability. The single mention of 'processing' in Segment 1 is part of a citation list and not descriptive of actual data processing capabilities. None of the segments provide quantitative or qualitative disclosures about the organization's ability to process data, computational resources, system capacity, or related performance indicators. Furthermore, all retrieval matches are based on low-scoring keyword matches (maximum match score 0.667), with no semantic relevance to the ESG metric in question. Therefore, there is no meaningful disclosure of the metric 'Data processing capacity'.
- **Evidence Segments**: P015_S002, P001_S007, P001_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that future documents include explicit discussion of data processing infrastructure, including metrics such as data ingestion rates, processing throughput, storage capacity, and computational resource allocation.
  - Use clear and standardized terminology related to data processing capacity to improve keyword and semantic retrieval accuracy.
  - Include dedicated sections in sustainability or ESG reports addressing digital infrastructure capabilities, especially if relevant to environmental or social governance impacts.
  - Link technical performance data to business operations or sustainability goals to enhance materiality and transparency.

#### (2) percentage outsourced (TC-SI-000.B)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: No relevant metric content found

#### (1) Amount of data storage (sasb_34_1_Amount_of_data_storage)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention keywords related to 'data' and 'storage' (e.g., 'parallel hash table', 'efficient storage', 'space efficiently store data associated with cliques'), these references are purely technical and algorithmic in nature, focusing on data structures and computational efficiency in graph algorithms. None of the segments provide any quantitative or qualitative disclosure regarding the actual amount of data storage used, managed, or impacted by the organization or system in an ESG context. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.667 or 0.333), indicating only partial relevance, and no semantic retrieval results are present that might have indicated deeper contextual understanding. The content discusses theoretical computer science concepts such as parallel hash tables and bucketing structures, but does not disclose any operational, environmental, or governance-related metrics about data storage volume, energy use, infrastructure scale, or related ESG impacts. Therefore, there is no meaningful disclosure of the metric 'Amount of data storage' as required under ESG reporting standards.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S003, P007_S006, P009_S001
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide explicit numerical disclosures on total data storage capacity used (e.g., in terabytes or petabytes), distinguishing between cloud and on-premise storage.
  - Include information on data storage growth trends over time, energy efficiency of storage systems, and alignment with sustainability goals.
  - Clarify whether data storage metrics are reported at rest or in transit, and specify the geographic distribution of stored data for compliance and risk assessment purposes.

#### (2) percentage outsourced (TC-SI-000.C)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: No relevant metric content found
