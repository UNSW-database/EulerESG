## Detailed Analysis Results

### ❌ Not Disclosed

#### Number of customers whose information is used for secondary purposes (sasb_4_Number_of_customers_whose_information_is_used_for_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments, there is no explicit disclosure of the metric 'Number of customers whose information is used for secondary purposes'. While several segments reference data privacy, customer information, and internal policies (e.g., Global Data Privacy Policy, customer access to privacy statements, and efforts to enhance customer control via the Privacy Center), none provide any quantitative data or even qualitative descriptions specifically addressing the use of customer information for secondary purposes. The mention of 'legitimate business purposes' in Segment 1 is vague and does not confirm whether such purposes constitute 'secondary uses' as typically defined in privacy frameworks (e.g., uses beyond the primary purpose for which data was collected). Additionally, although Segment 2 references customer trust and data control, and Segment 4 mentions data usage in broader contexts, no segment reports a count, estimate, or even a discussion of the scope of customers affected by secondary use of their data. The retrieval types are primarily keyword-based with moderate to low match scores (highest being 0.556), and matched keywords such as 'customers', 'data', 'privacy', and 'purposes' appear in general contexts unrelated to the specific metric. There is no evidence of structured reporting, methodology, or numerical data related to this metric in the provided content.
- **Evidence Segments**: P071_S002, P067_T000, P071_S009
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly define what constitutes 'secondary purposes' in relation to customer data usage to improve transparency.
  - Report the number or percentage of customers whose personal information is used for purposes beyond the primary service delivery, with clear scope and methodology.
  - Include this metric in future ESG reporting tables with a defined measurement approach, such as opt-in rates or data usage audits.
  - Enhance disclosure by describing customer consent mechanisms and controls related to secondary data use.

#### Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with customer privacy (sasb_5_Total_amount_of_monetary_losses_as_a_result_of_leg)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no explicit disclosure of the metric 'Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with customer privacy'. Although several segments mention customer data, data privacy, and related policies (e.g., Segment 3 references the Global Data Privacy Policy, and Segments 2 and 4 discuss data sanitization and customer-related data handling), none report any financial losses arising from legal proceedings tied to customer privacy breaches. The retrieval results are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.400–0.500), and the matched keywords (e.g., 'customer', 'data', 'privacy', 'associated', 'total') appear to have triggered relevance based on contextual proximity rather than substantive content related to legal or financial disclosures. No tables or textual statements provide figures, narratives, or even qualitative mentions of litigation outcomes, settlements, fines, or penalties related to customer privacy violations. The disclosed metrics in Segments 1, 4, and 5 focus on environmental and social inclusion performance, not legal or financial risk exposure from privacy issues. Therefore, the metric is not disclosed in any form—quantitative or qualitative.
- **Evidence Segments**: P103_T000, P038_T000, P071_S002
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose any monetary losses from legal proceedings related to customer privacy, even if the amount is zero, to demonstrate transparency and compliance with SASB standards.
  - Include a dedicated section in the ESG report for legal and regulatory risks related to data privacy, especially given the materiality of customer data handling in the technology sector.
  - Enhance keyword and semantic tagging systems to ensure that future retrieval of privacy-related financial impacts is more accurately aligned with relevant disclosures, should they exist.

#### (1) Number of law enforcement requests for customer information,  (sasb_6_1_Number_of_law_enforcement_requests_for_custome)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments reference privacy, customer data, and requests (e.g., Data Subject Rights requests, privacy policies, and customer trust), none of the retrieved content explicitly discloses the specific metric 'Number of law enforcement requests for customer information.' The matched keywords such as 'privacy,' 'customer,' 'data,' and 'requests' appear in contexts related to general privacy practices, internal policies, and customer control mechanisms (e.g., Privacy Center), but there is no mention of law enforcement requests or quantified disclosures in this regard. The retrieval types are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (up to 0.625), but the semantic relevance to the specific metric remains low. No numerical data or qualitative descriptions related to government or law enforcement data requests are present. As such, the disclosure for this SASB metric is absent.
- **Evidence Segments**: P071_S009, P067_T000, P071_S002
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the number of law enforcement requests received for customer information, segmented by region or jurisdiction if applicable, to meet SASB and ESG transparency standards.
  - Include a dedicated section on government data requests in the ESG or privacy report, outlining policies, oversight mechanisms, and annual statistics.
  - Enhance keyword and semantic discoverability by tagging relevant disclosures with standardized terms such as 'law enforcement requests,' 'government data access,' and 'customer data disclosure.'

#### (2) number of customers whose information was requested,  (sasb_7_2_number_of_customers_whose_information_was_requ)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments reference privacy, customers, data, and information—keywords related to the metric 'number of customers whose information was requested'—none of the retrieved content provides any quantitative data, disclosure, or even qualitative discussion regarding government or third-party requests for customer information. The segments primarily focus on Dell's privacy policies, customer trust initiatives, data governance frameworks, and efforts to enhance user control over personal data (e.g., Privacy Center expansion, SBOMs, Zero Trust). While these reflect broader privacy commitments, they do not address the specific metric in question. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.571 and 0.429), indicating relevance to general themes but not to the specific disclosure requirement. There is no mention of legal requests, data disclosures to authorities, or metrics tracking affected customers, which are central to this SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P071_S002, P071_S009
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose the number of customer data requests received from governments or third parties during the reporting period, aligned with SASB standards.
  - Include a clear methodology for how such requests are tracked, reviewed, and reported, including definitions of scope and exclusions.
  - Enhance transparency by providing trends over time and geographic breakdowns of data requests, if possible.
  - Integrate this metric into the Trust or Privacy section of future ESG reports with direct references to compliance with privacy rights and regulatory obligations.

#### (3) percentage resulting in disclosure (sasb_8_3_percentage_resulting_in_disclosure)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'sasb_8_3_percentage_resulting_in_disclosure' pertains to the percentage of data incidents or requests that result in disclosure of personal data, likely in the context of privacy rights or regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). While multiple segments reference data privacy, customer control over personal data, and data usage (e.g., expansion of the Privacy Center, de-identified patient data access), none provide a quantified percentage or metric specifically tied to disclosures resulting from data-related requests or incidents. The segments are primarily retrieved via keyword matching (privacy, data, resulting) with moderate match scores (0.400), but the content is general and lacks the specific numerical or procedural disclosure required by this SASB metric. There is no explicit mention of data subject requests, legal disclosures, breach reporting rates, or any calculated percentage related to disclosure outcomes. Therefore, although the topic of data privacy is addressed contextually, the specific metric is not disclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P010_T000, P010_S013, P011_S020
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the percentage of data subject access requests (DSARs) that resulted in personal data disclosure, if applicable.
  - Include metrics on data breach incidents and the proportion that led to regulatory or individual disclosures.
  - Clarify the process and criteria for data disclosure in response to legal, regulatory, or customer-driven requests.
  - Align future disclosures with SASB standards by providing quantifiable KPIs related to data privacy outcomes.

#### (1) Number of data breaches (sasb_9_1_Number_of_data_breaches)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention related concepts such as 'data', 'security', and 'privacy', and some are tagged with keywords relevant to the metric (e.g., 'security', 'data'), none of the retrieved segments provide any specific disclosure regarding the 'Number of data breaches'—the core requirement of the SASB metric sasb_9_1_Number_of_data_breaches. The content focuses on general commitments to trust, data privacy, security initiatives (e.g., Zero Trust architecture), and product security features, but there is no quantitative or qualitative reporting on actual data breach incidents during the reporting period. The absence of explicit mention of data breaches, their frequency, impact, or mitigation efforts means the metric is not disclosed. Additionally, while some segments were retrieved via keyword matching with moderate scores (up to 0.75), these are contextually peripheral and do not constitute substantive disclosure. There is no evidence of semantic-level discussion about breach events either. Therefore, despite the relevance of the topic area, the specific metric remains undisclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P006_T000, P011_S020
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the number of data breaches occurring during the fiscal year, segmented by severity or impact if applicable.
  - Include context such as root causes, affected data types (e.g., personal data), and remediation actions taken.
  - Align future disclosures with SASB standards by creating a dedicated section for cybersecurity incident metrics.
  - Enhance indexation and tagging of data breach-related content to improve retrieval accuracy for ESG analysis systems.

#### (2) percentage that are personal data breaches (sasb_10_2_percentage_that_are_personal_data_breaches)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although the metric 'percentage that are personal data breaches' (sasb_10_2_percentage_that_are_personal_data_breaches) is thematically related to data privacy and security—topics discussed across multiple segments—there is no direct quantitative disclosure or specific data provided regarding the actual percentage of personal data breaches. The retrieved segments emphasize Dell's strategic goals and qualitative progress in trust, privacy, and security (e.g., Zero Trust solutions, SBOM publication, Privacy Center expansion), and repeatedly reference 'personal data' in the context of customer control and transparency. However, none of the segments report a numerical value, performance metric, or statistical disclosure related to personal data breaches. The matching keywords (e.g., 'personal', 'data', 'percentage', 'that') appear in broader discussions of privacy initiatives rather than in the context of breach metrics. Furthermore, the highest retrieval match score (0.667) indicates only moderate keyword relevance, and no semantic indication of breach statistics is present. Therefore, while the topic is contextually relevant, there is no actual disclosure of the requested metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P091_T000, P105_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the percentage of data breaches involving personal data on an annual basis, aligned with SASB standards.
  - Include a dedicated metric table for cybersecurity and data privacy incidents, with clear definitions and scope (e.g., total breaches, personal data breaches, affected records).
  - Enhance disclosure quality by providing both qualitative context and quantitative data to support trust and privacy goals.
  - Clarify the methodology for identifying and classifying personal data breaches to improve transparency and comparability.

#### (3) number of customers affected (sasb_11_3_number_of_customers_affected)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments, there is no explicit mention or reporting of the metric 'sasb_11_3_number_of_customers_affected' or its equivalent description—specifically, the number of customers affected by data breaches, security incidents, or privacy violations. While multiple segments reference customers, data, trust, security, and privacy (e.g., Zero Trust initiatives, SBOMs, Privacy Center expansion), these focus on proactive measures, goals, and general performance indicators rather than quantifying actual customer impact from incidents. The tag information indicates keyword matches for 'customers', 'data', and 'number', but these are associated with high-level business metrics (e.g., revenue, countries served, patents) or goal-related KPIs unrelated to customer impact from security or privacy events. The retrieval types are primarily keyword-based with moderate to high match scores, but none lead to content that discloses the specific numerical data or even a qualitative description of affected customers. No table, figure, or narrative text provides the required metric or a proxy for it. Therefore, despite contextual relevance to trust and data protection, the specific disclosure for the number of affected customers is absent.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P006_T000, P103_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the number of customers affected by data breaches or security incidents in alignment with SASB standards, even if the number is zero, to demonstrate transparency and compliance.
  - Introduce a dedicated disclosure section for customer impact metrics under the 'Trust' or 'Security and Privacy' material topics, including definitions, scope, and methodology for measuring affected customers.
  - Enhance metadata tagging and indexing to ensure that disclosures related to customer impact from security events are retrievable via both keyword and semantic search, improving auditability and stakeholder access.

#### percentage of recovered materials that were (2) reused,  (sasb_14_percentage_of_recovered_materials_that_were_2_re)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tags, there is no direct disclosure of the specific metric 'percentage of recovered materials that were reused' (SASB TC-HW-410a.5 or equivalent). While multiple segments discuss related concepts such as recycled materials, e-waste recovery, product collection, and reused packaging, none provide a quantified percentage of recovered materials that were specifically reused. Segment 1 reports that 90% of e-waste was recycled but does not specify reuse rates. Segments 2 and 3 mention reused packaging and expanded goals to include reused materials, but explicitly state that 'measurement and reporting capabilities for reused packaging are still in development' and will be reflected in future reports. This indicates that the organization currently lacks the systems to report on reuse as a distinct metric. The keyword matches in the segments are primarily related to broader terms like 'reused', 'materials', 'product', and 'percentage', but these do not equate to reporting the exact SASB-defined metric. The retrieval types are keyword-based with moderate to low match scores (0.750 being the highest), suggesting limited contextual relevance. No semantic-level contextual match confirms the presence of this specific metric. Therefore, while there is evidence of intent and strategic direction toward reuse, there is no actual disclosed data for this precise metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P109_T000, P084_T000, P103_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Develop and implement measurement systems to track the percentage of recovered materials that are reused, particularly distinguishing reuse from recycling.
  - Align future reporting with SASB TC-HW-410a.5 by clearly defining and disclosing the reuse rate of recovered materials.
  - Enhance data collection from both owned and third-party recovery channels to improve accuracy and completeness of reuse metrics.
  - Provide interim disclosures or qualitative updates on progress toward reuse capabilities, especially for reused packaging, to demonstrate transparency during system development.

#### percentage of recovered materials that were (4) landfilled (sasb_16_percentage_of_recovered_materials_that_were_4_la)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments discuss end-of-life product recovery, recycling, and reuse of materials (e.g., e-waste recovery of 91,000 tons and 90% recycling rate), none explicitly disclose the percentage of recovered materials that were landfilled. The metric in question specifically requires data on the landfill portion of recovered materials, which is a subset of the overall waste stream. While the company reports on recycling rates and use of recycled materials, there is no mention of landfilling within the recovered materials stream. The retrieved segments are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.500–0.750), and while they contain relevant context around material recovery and circularity, they do not provide the specific quantitative breakdown required for this metric. No direct or indirect data point addresses what portion of the 91,000 tons of recovered e-waste was landfilled, making the disclosure insufficient for this SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P109_T000, P010_T000, P030_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the percentage or weight of recovered materials that were landfilled, as required by SASB TC-HW-410a.4, to ensure full compliance with the metric definition.
  - Break down the disposition of recovered materials into categories: recycled, reused, energy recovered, and landfilled, to improve transparency and support circular economy claims.
  - Include a dedicated section or table in future ESG reports that tracks the full fate of end-of-life materials, aligning with SASB and GRI standards for waste management disclosure.

#### Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with anti-competitive behaviour regulations (sasb_17_Total_amount_of_monetary_losses_as_a_result_of_leg)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no evidence of disclosure related to the metric 'Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with anti-competitive behaviour regulations'. The segments retrieved are primarily based on keyword matches such as 'with', 'result', 'total', and 'competitive', which appear in contexts unrelated to legal or regulatory financial penalties. For example, references to 'competitive' in Segment 1 pertain to competitive systems in product recycling programs, not anti-competitive behavior. The term 'result' appears in the context of program outcomes (e.g., impact measurement), not legal proceedings. All disclosed data in the segments focus on environmental sustainability, digital inclusion, skills training, and circular economy initiatives—none mention legal proceedings, antitrust regulations, or financial losses due to litigation. The matching score across all segments is uniformly low (0.300), and the retrieval type is keyword-based, indicating weak relevance. No semantic alignment with the intended metric is present. Therefore, the metric is not disclosed in any meaningful or direct manner.
- **Evidence Segments**: P038_T000, P091_T000, P091_S004
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Enhance disclosure practices by explicitly reporting financial impacts of legal proceedings, particularly those related to antitrust or anti-competitive regulations, in line with SASB standards.
  - Improve keyword and semantic tagging accuracy in ESG reports to ensure that metrics are correctly indexed and retrievable based on regulatory and financial terminology.
  - Include a dedicated section on legal and regulatory risks and outcomes, with quantitative data on monetary losses from litigation, to support transparency and stakeholder accountability.

#### Average actual sustained download speed of (1) owned and commercially-associated content (sasb_18_Average_actual_sustained_download_speed_of_1_own)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no mention of the specific metric 'Average actual sustained download speed of (1) owned and commercially-associated content' in any of the provided content. The segments primarily focus on sustainability-related metrics such as recycled content in products and packaging, ocean-bound plastic usage, responsible electronics disposition, and digital inclusion. Although keywords like 'content' and 'owned' appear in multiple segments and were used in retrieval, they refer to material content in products or packaging, digital inclusion programs, or open content as digital public goods—not to network performance or download speed metrics. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with relatively low match scores (0.200 or below), indicating weak relevance to the target metric. No data, methodology, or discussion related to download speed performance is present. Therefore, despite some keyword overlap, the disclosed information is entirely unrelated to the specified metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P084_T000, P103_T000, P111_S020
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure that performance metrics related to network or service quality, such as download speeds, are explicitly reported in relevant sections of the ESG report, particularly if they are material to stakeholder expectations or industry standards.
  - Improve metadata tagging and retrieval systems by distinguishing between different contexts of commonly used terms like 'content' (e.g., material content vs. digital content) to enhance precision in future disclosures.
  - Consider including a dedicated section for digital service performance metrics if they align with the company's ESG materiality assessment, especially in relation to digital inclusion or technology access.

#### Average actual sustained download speed of (2) non-associated content (sasb_19_Average_actual_sustained_download_speed_of_2_non)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments do not contain any direct or indirect disclosure related to the metric 'Average actual sustained download speed of (2) non-associated content'. Although several segments mention keywords such as 'internet', 'speed', and 'content', these references are contextually unrelated to network performance metrics or download speed measurements. The keyword matches are superficial and result from general terminology (e.g., 'internet' in discussions about access programs, 'content' in reference to recycled materials or digital goods), with low match scores (all ≤0.200) and no semantic linkage to technical network performance data. None of the segments report numerical values, measurement methodologies, or performance benchmarks related to download speeds for non-associated content. Furthermore, there is no indication of monitoring, tracking, or disclosing such a metric in the context of ESG or sustainability reporting. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based, and the low match scores reinforce the lack of relevance.
- **Evidence Segments**: P040_S004, P111_S020, P003_S000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Include quantitative disclosures on network performance metrics, specifically average sustained download speeds for non-associated content, in future ESG reports.
  - Clearly define the methodology for measuring download speeds, including test conditions, sample size, and network environment.
  - Enhance indexing and tagging of technical performance data in reports to improve retrieval accuracy for ESG metrics.
  - Align disclosures with SASB standards for telecommunications or relevant industry guidelines to ensure completeness and comparability.

#### Description of risks and opportunities associated with net neutrality, paid peering, zero-rating, and related practices (sasb_20_Description_of_risks_and_opportunities_associated_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention the terms 'risks and opportunities associated with'—which partially match the metric's focus—the context of each reference is unrelated to net neutrality, paid peering, zero-rating, or similar digital policy or internet governance practices. The retrieved segments discuss environmental impact (Segment 1), product recycling and asset recovery (Segment 2), manufacturing risks (Segment 3), cybersecurity vulnerabilities (Segment 4), and board succession risks (Segment 5). All retrieval types are keyword-based with a low match score (0.300), indicating weak relevance. There is no semantic or contextual evidence that the company addresses the specific regulatory, competitive, or operational risks and opportunities related to net neutrality or internet traffic management practices. Therefore, the disclosures, while containing matching keywords, do not substantively cover the intended scope of the metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P018_S013, P038_T000, P060_S012
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose risks and opportunities arising from regulatory changes or market practices related to net neutrality and internet traffic management.
  - Describe how paid peering or zero-rating arrangements may affect business operations, customer access, or competitive positioning, if applicable.
  - Enhance disclosure granularity by differentiating between regulatory, operational, and strategic implications of internet policy practices.
  - Incorporate industry-specific frameworks such as those from FCC, BEREC, or OECD to contextualize the company’s stance on net neutrality-related issues.

#### (1) System average interruption duration (sasb_21_1_System_average_interruption_duration)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments do not contain any direct or indirect mention of the metric 'System average interruption duration' (SAIDI), which is a reliability performance indicator commonly used in the utilities and infrastructure sectors to measure the average duration of power outages experienced by customers over a given period. While several segments reference the term 'system' and are associated with technology, sustainability, recycling, and systemic risks, these references are contextually unrelated to electrical grid reliability or service interruption metrics. The keyword matches (e.g., 'system', 'from', 'technology') are generic and result in low match scores (all ≤0.400), indicating weak relevance. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based, not semantic, suggesting the matches were driven by superficial term overlap rather than conceptual alignment. No numerical data, definitions, methodologies, or discussions related to power supply continuity, outage duration, or grid performance are present. Therefore, there is no evidence of disclosure for this specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P111_S013, P017_T001, P033_S011
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Include explicit reporting on grid reliability metrics such as System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) if applicable to operations.
  - Ensure future disclosures align with SASB standards by referencing the exact metric name and providing time-series data, calculation methodology, and operational context.
  - Enhance document indexing and metadata tagging to improve semantic retrieval accuracy for ESG metric mapping.

#### (2) system average interruption frequency (sasb_22_2_system_average_interruption_frequency)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'system average interruption frequency' (SAIFI), typically used in utility and infrastructure sectors, measures the average number of power outages experienced by customers over a given period. It is a key reliability indicator for electrical distribution systems. After analyzing all retrieved segments, no direct or indirect mention of SAIFI, power outage frequency, grid reliability, service interruptions, or related performance data was found. While several segments reference 'system' and 'technology'—notably in the context of closed-loop systems, asset recovery, and digital infrastructure—these uses are unrelated to electrical service reliability or interruption metrics. The keyword-based retrieval results show low match scores (all ≤0.400) and are driven by generic terms like 'system', 'from', and 'technology', which appear in broader sustainability or operational contexts. There is no evidence of disclosure related to service continuity, outage tracking, or grid performance. Therefore, despite contextual mentions of systems and infrastructure, the specific ESG metric in question is not addressed in any of the provided content.
- **Evidence Segments**: P111_S013, P017_T001, P033_S011
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report on system reliability metrics such as SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index) if applicable, especially if the organization operates or relies on critical power infrastructure.
  - Include operational data on service interruptions, outage frequency, and mitigation efforts in future ESG disclosures to align with SASB standards for infrastructure-dependent sectors.
  - Enhance keyword indexing and content tagging to ensure that technical system performance metrics are accurately captured and retrievable in compliance assessments.

#### (3) customer average interruption duration (sasb_23_3_customer_average_interruption_duration)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments were retrieved based on keyword matches such as 'customer' and 'technology', but none of the content directly addresses the metric 'customer average interruption duration' (sasb_23_3_customer_average_interruption_duration), which pertains to service reliability and uptime in customer operations—specifically, the average duration of service or power interruptions experienced by customers. The retrieved content primarily discusses customer trust, data sanitization, asset recovery, recycling programs, and sustainability services. While these topics involve customer-facing services, they are unrelated to service continuity, network reliability, or outage duration metrics. The tag information indicates all segments were retrieved via keyword matching with a moderate score (0.300), but no semantic or contextual relevance to the specific metric is present. There is no mention of outage tracking, service level agreements (SLAs), system availability, or reliability performance data. Therefore, there is no evidence of disclosure for this specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P010_T000, P017_T001, P037_S004
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Include service reliability metrics such as average interruption duration, frequency of outages, and system uptime in future ESG or sustainability reports.
  - Align disclosures with SASB standards for the technology sector, particularly around infrastructure resilience and customer service continuity.
  - Implement monitoring and reporting mechanisms for service availability and outage management to support future disclosures.
  - Clearly differentiate between customer data security, asset management, and service reliability topics to avoid irrelevant content retrieval.

#### Discussion of systems to provide unimpeded service during service disruptions (sasb_24_Discussion_of_systems_to_provide_unimpeded_service)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'Discussion of systems to provide unimpeded service during service disruptions' requires disclosure on operational resilience, business continuity, or disaster recovery systems that ensure uninterrupted service delivery during disruptions. While several retrieved segments mention systems, technology, and services, they are primarily focused on sustainability, circular economy, asset recovery, recycling programs, and digital inclusion. The keyword matches (e.g., 'systems', 'technology', 'provide') appear in contexts unrelated to service continuity or operational resilience. For example, references to 'closed-loop systems' pertain to material recycling, not IT or service availability. No segment discusses backup systems, redundancy, failover mechanisms, incident response, or continuity planning that would directly address unimpeded service during disruptions. The retrieval type is keyword-based with low match scores (all ≤0.400), and no semantic relevance to service continuity is evident. Therefore, there is no substantive disclosure related to the intended scope of the metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P038_T000, P005_S008, P006_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly describe business continuity management (BCM) and disaster recovery (DR) frameworks in place to maintain service availability during disruptions.
  - Include information on IT infrastructure redundancy, data center failover capabilities, and cybersecurity incident response protocols.
  - Report on service level agreements (SLAs) related to uptime and system availability, especially for cloud and managed services.
  - Enhance disclosure with examples of past service disruptions and how systems ensured minimal impact to customers.
  - Use semantic keywords such as 'business continuity', 'disaster recovery', 'service resilience', and 'uninterrupted operations' to improve future retrieval accuracy.

#### Number of wireless subscribers (sasb_25_Number_of_wireless_subscribers)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments were retrieved based on the keyword 'number' with a consistent but low match score of 0.333, none of the content directly mentions or provides data related to the metric 'Number of wireless subscribers' (sasb_25_Number_of_wireless_subscribers). The retrieved segments reference general numerical facts about Dell Technologies, such as the number of countries operated in, team members, patents, and revenue, but there is no mention of wireless subscribers or any related KPI. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based, not semantic, and the matched keyword 'number' appears to be too generic, leading to irrelevant extractions. The context of the document, which focuses on IT infrastructure, client devices, and enterprise solutions, further suggests that wireless subscriber data is not applicable to Dell's business model, which does not include wireless telecommunications services. Therefore, there is no evidence of disclosure for this specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S006, P004_S010, P005_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure keyword-based retrieval systems are refined with context filtering to avoid false positives from generic terms like 'number'.
  - Consider implementing semantic search to better align retrieved content with the intended metric context.
  - If the company does not have wireless subscriber operations, formally disclose the metric as 'Not Applicable' with a business model justification to meet SASB completeness expectations.

#### Number of wireline subscribers (sasb_26_Number_of_wireline_subscribers)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The retrieved segments are primarily identified through keyword matching with the term 'number', which appears in general section headers like 'BY THE NUMBERS' and in descriptive phrases such as 'approximate number of countries Dell operates in globally'. However, none of the segments contain any data or reference specifically related to 'Number of wireline subscribers' as defined by the metric code sasb_26_Number_of_wireline_subscribers. The matching score across all segments is uniformly low (0.333), and the retrieval type is keyword-based, indicating weak relevance. There is no semantic or contextual evidence that Dell Technologies discloses information on wireline subscribers in the provided content. The metric is highly specific to telecommunications infrastructure or service provisioning, which does not align with Dell’s core business segments as presented in the report. Therefore, there is no substantive disclosure for this metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S006, P004_S010, P005_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Ensure disclosure of SASB-relevant metrics specific to the company's industry classification; if wireline subscribers are not applicable, provide a clear rationale for omission based on business scope.

  - Include a SASB metric alignment table in the ESG report appendix to clarify which metrics are applicable and disclosed.

#### Number of broadband subscribers (sasb_27_Number_of_broadband_subscribers)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments were retrieved based on the keyword 'number' with a consistent match score of 0.333, none of the segments contain any data specifically related to the metric 'Number of broadband subscribers' (sasb_27_Number_of_broadband_subscribers). The retrieved content includes general numerical information such as the number of countries Dell operates in, team member count, revenue, and R&D investment, but there is no mention of broadband subscribers or any related KPI. The presence of the 'BY THE NUMBERS' section suggests a potential location for such metrics, but no relevant data is present. All retrievals are keyword-based with moderate scores, indicating weak relevance, and no semantic matches were found, further suggesting the absence of meaningful disclosure on this specific metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P003_S006, P004_S010, P005_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the number of broadband subscribers in future ESG reports if applicable, particularly within the 'BY THE NUMBERS' or 'Digital Inclusion' sections.
  - Enhance metadata tagging and indexing of numerical disclosures to improve retrieval accuracy for SASB-based metrics.
  - Conduct a gap analysis against the SASB standard for the telecommunications or hardware sector to ensure all relevant metrics are being tracked and disclosed.

### ⚠️ Partially Disclosed

#### Description of policies and practices relating to targeted advertising and customer privacy (sasb_3_Description_of_policies_and_practices_relating_to_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments collectively confirm that Dell Technologies discloses policies and practices related to customer privacy, particularly in the context of data control, transparency, and trust. Multiple segments reference the enhanced Privacy Center, which supports customer choice and control over personal data, available in 74 locations globally. The company also references its internal Global Data Privacy Policy, which governs data collection, storage, and use, aligning with legal and regulatory requirements. Additionally, the Trust 2030 goal and associated key drivers (e.g., easier data control annually through 2030) indicate a strategic commitment to privacy practices. However, while the disclosures touch on customer data privacy and internal governance, there is limited explicit discussion of *targeted advertising* policies or practices—only indirect references via 'targeted global public and private sector organizations' in the context of Zero Trust solutions, which is unrelated to advertising. The keyword matches (e.g., 'targeted', 'practices', 'customer', 'privacy') have moderate to low match scores (0.556 being the highest), and retrieval was keyword-based, suggesting the content was not strongly semantically aligned with targeted advertising. Therefore, while customer privacy practices are disclosed with reasonable detail, the absence of direct disclosure on targeted advertising limits the completeness of the response to the full scope of the metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P010_T000, P067_T000, P071_S002
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose policies and practices regarding targeted advertising, including data usage, consent mechanisms, and third-party sharing.
  - Clarify whether customer data is used for behavioral advertising and detail opt-in/opt-out processes.
  - Enhance disclosure by providing examples of privacy-by-design practices in marketing technologies.
  - Include metrics or KPIs specifically tied to advertising privacy compliance (e.g., consent rates, ad transparency tools).
  - Consider integrating semantic indexing of content to improve alignment between ESG metrics and reported disclosures.

#### Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security risks, including use of third-party cybersecurity standards (sasb_12_Description_of_approach_to_identifying_and_address)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments collectively indicate that Dell has a structured and proactive approach to identifying and addressing data security risks, with specific emphasis on cybersecurity frameworks and third-party standards. Key evidence includes the development of a Zero Trust solution (Project Fort Zero), which is undergoing U.S. government validation, demonstrating alignment with recognized third-party cybersecurity standards. Additionally, the company references its use of security programs to manage and mitigate cybersecurity risk, and highlights efforts to provide transparency through Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for products, which includes disclosure of third-party and open-source components—directly relating to supply chain and data security risk management. The mention of RBA-certified third-party audits further supports the use of external standards in risk assessment, although these are more focused on social and environmental responsibility than cybersecurity. However, while the company outlines strategic initiatives and goals, there is limited detailed description of the full end-to-end risk identification and mitigation process, such as specific methodologies, tools, or regular assessment cycles for data security risks. The absence of a comprehensive narrative on how threats are systematically detected, evaluated, and addressed across the organization reduces the depth of disclosure. Most retrieved segments are keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.300–0.500), suggesting relevance but not high contextual precision, and no semantic retrieval results are present, which may indicate gaps in deeper contextual alignment.
- **Evidence Segments**: P067_T000, P060_S011, P069_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a detailed description of the end-to-end process for identifying, assessing, and mitigating data security risks, including risk assessment methodologies and frequency.
  - Clarify how third-party cybersecurity standards (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001, SOC 2) are specifically integrated into Dell’s security framework beyond referencing government validation.
  - Include information on internal governance structures, roles, and responsibilities for cybersecurity risk management.
  - Enhance transparency by disclosing results of cybersecurity audits, penetration testing, or incident response performance metrics.

#### (1) Materials recovered through take-back programmes,  (sasb_13_1_Materials_recovered_through_take-back_programm)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'Materials recovered through take-back programmes' is indirectly addressed across multiple segments, with the most relevant information found in Segment 1, which reports 'Weight of end-of-life products and e-waste recovered: 91,000 tons' under the E-waste recovered KPI, tagged with SASB TC-HW-410a.4—directly related to the SASB metric in question. This indicates a partial but substantive disclosure, as the total weight of recovered materials through take-back services is provided, though it is not explicitly broken down by material type or specifically labeled as 'materials recovered through take-back programmes.' Segment 3 and Segment 4 reinforce the existence and importance of take-back and closed-loop recovery systems, confirming the operational context for material recovery. However, the lack of granular data (e.g., by material category or recovery rate per product line) and absence of a direct label matching the metric name limits the precision of the disclosure. All retrieved segments are keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.500–0.625), suggesting the content is contextually relevant but not highly targeted to the exact metric phrasing. While the company clearly discloses e-waste recovery volumes and describes its take-back mechanisms, the linkage to 'materials recovered' as distinct from total e-waste is implied rather than explicit.
- **Evidence Segments**: P109_T000, P010_T000, P030_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report 'materials recovered through take-back programmes' as a standalone metric, ideally broken down by material type (e.g., plastic, metal) to align with SASB disclosure expectations.
  - Improve labeling and cross-walk between reported KPIs and specific SASB metric codes to enhance traceability and transparency.
  - Include the percentage or weight of recovered materials that are reused or recycled back into new products to strengthen circular economy reporting.

#### percentage of recovered materials that were (3) recycled (sasb_15_percentage_of_recovered_materials_that_were_3_re)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'percentage of recovered materials that were (3) recycled' is indirectly addressed through multiple segments, particularly in Segment 1, which explicitly states 'E-waste recovered: Weight of end-of-life products and e-waste recovered: 91,000 tons; Percentage recycled: 90%'. This directly corresponds to the metric in question, indicating that 90% of the recovered materials were recycled. The tag information for Segment 1 shows a high match score (0.875) and includes relevant keywords such as 'recovered', 'recycled', 'materials', and 'percentage', with retrieval by keyword, indicating strong relevance. Other segments (2–5) provide contextual support around recycling practices, circular economy initiatives, and use of recycled materials in products and packaging, but do not directly report the specific percentage of recovered materials that were recycled. While the core data point is present, the disclosure lacks a detailed breakdown of what constitutes 'recycled' (e.g., closed-loop vs. open-loop, material types, geographic scope), and there is no explicit linkage to the SASB metric code (sasb_15_percentage_of_recovered_materials_that_were_3_re) or methodology specific to that standard. The absence of methodological detail and limited direct referencing of the metric framework reduces the overall quality from high to medium.
- **Evidence Segments**: P109_T000, P030_T000, P033_S011
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly label and report the metric using the full SASB metric name and code to improve traceability and compliance clarity.
  - Provide a detailed methodology for how the 'percentage recycled' is calculated, including definitions of 'recovered', 'recycled', material categories, and whether reuse is excluded or accounted for separately.
  - Break down the 90% recycling rate by material type (e.g., plastics, metals) and region to enhance transparency and alignment with SASB's sector-specific expectations.
  - Clarify whether the recycling percentage includes only closed-loop recycling or both closed- and open-loop systems, as this affects circularity claims.

#### Network traffic (sasb_28_Network_traffic)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'Network traffic' (sasb_28_Network_traffic) is indirectly addressed across multiple segments, primarily through references to networking systems, energy efficiency of networking equipment, and optimization of transportation and data networks. While the term 'network traffic' itself is not explicitly quantified or defined in terms of data volume, bandwidth, or performance metrics, several segments mention 'networking systems', 'networking equipment', and 'optimize our transportation network', indicating organizational engagement with network-related infrastructure and efficiency. The context suggests that the focus is on energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and product design for networking hardware rather than direct disclosure of network traffic data. All segments were retrieved via keyword matching with moderate scores (0.500), and none used semantic retrieval, indicating that the connection to the metric is surface-level and lacks deep contextual elaboration. The absence of quantitative data on actual network traffic volumes, utilization rates, or trends limits the completeness of disclosure.
- **Evidence Segments**: P017_T001, P017_S012, P020_S001
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly define and disclose network traffic metrics such as data throughput, bandwidth utilization, or network efficiency KPIs.
