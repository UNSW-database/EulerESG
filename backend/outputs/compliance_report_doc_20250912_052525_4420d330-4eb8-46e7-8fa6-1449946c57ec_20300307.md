## Detailed Analysis Results

### ❌ Not Disclosed

#### Percentage of (1) gender for (a) executive management (sasb_0_Percentage_of_1_gender_for_a_executive_managem)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While several segments reference diversity, inclusion, gender representation, and executive leadership levels (e.g., Executive Committee, senior leadership), none provide any specific quantitative data regarding the percentage of a particular gender in executive management. The content acknowledges Macquarie's commitment to diversity objectives and reporting on workforce composition, including gender, at senior levels, and mentions accountability mechanisms and policy frameworks. However, despite multiple references to diversity goals and governance oversight (Segments 3, 4, and 5), no actual numerical values or percentages related to gender representation in executive management are disclosed. The keyword-based retrieval results indicate relevance to the topic but do not yield concrete metrics. There is also no indication of data being omitted due to semantic proximity without explicit mention. Therefore, while contextually relevant information is present, there is no direct disclosure of the required metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P051_S015, P043_S014, P047_S004
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose specific percentages of gender representation within executive management annually, aligned with SASB standards.
  - Include a dedicated section in the ESG or Annual Report that breaks down leadership demographics by gender, particularly for Executive Committee and other senior executive roles.
  - Enhance transparency by setting measurable diversity targets and tracking progress against them with clear metrics.

#### Percentage of (1) gender for (b) non-executive management (sasb_1_Percentage_of_1_gender_for_b_non-executive_man)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention diversity, gender, inclusion, and workforce composition—particularly in the context of DEI objectives, leadership accountability, and reporting to the Board Risk Committee (BRC)—there is no explicit quantitative or qualitative disclosure regarding the percentage of a specific gender within non-executive management. The retrieved segments are primarily keyword-based matches with moderate match scores (0.429), indicating only surface-level relevance. None of the content directly addresses the composition of non-executive management by gender, nor provides data or even narrative descriptions about gender representation in that specific leadership category. Segment 5 includes high-level DEI objectives and success measures such as 'diverse employee representation' and 'leader visibility based on diversity metrics,' but lacks disaggregation by executive level or specificity to non-executive management roles. Overall, while the organization demonstrates a commitment to diversity and reports on related initiatives, the specific metric requested is not disclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P043_S014, P047_S007, P051_S015
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a clear breakdown of gender representation across management levels, specifically distinguishing between executive and non-executive management.
  - Include quantifiable metrics in future reports, such as the percentage of women or other underrepresented genders in non-executive management positions.
  - Enhance transparency by aligning disclosures with recognized ESG frameworks like SASB standards, which require standardized reporting on workforce diversity metrics.
  - Strengthen reporting by linking DEI objectives to measurable outcomes at different organizational levels, including mid- and senior-level non-executive roles.

#### Percentage of (1) gender for (c) professionals (sasb_2_Percentage_of_1_gender_for_c_professionals)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While multiple segments reference diversity, inclusion, gender, and workforce composition—particularly in the context of DEI objectives, employee self-identification, and governance oversight (e.g., Board Risk Committee review)—there is no explicit disclosure of quantitative data for the percentage of a specific gender among professional roles. The document outlines frameworks, objectives, and success measures related to diversity representation and accountability but does not provide disaggregated workforce data by gender and job category (such as professionals). The retrieved segments are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.500), indicating relevance to general DEI themes but not to the specific metric in question. No semantic matches or high-confidence references to actual percentages or headcounts for gender within professional classifications were found.
- **Evidence Segments**: P047_S007, P074_T000, P075_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Publish a workforce composition breakdown by gender and job level/category, specifically identifying the proportion of each gender within professional roles.
  - Include tabular data or charts in the Annual Report or ESG supplement showing representation metrics aligned with SASB standards, such as sasb_2_Percentage_of_1_gender_for_c_professionals.
  - Enhance transparency by reporting on progress against diversity objectives with measurable outcomes, not just process indicators like training completion or leader objectives.

#### Percentage of (1) gender for (d) all other employees (sasb_3_Percentage_of_1_gender_for_d_all_other_employe)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While multiple segments reference diversity, inclusion, gender, and employee representation—particularly in the context of DEI objectives, workforce composition, and data collection—there is no explicit numerical data or percentage provided for the specific metric 'Percentage of (1) gender for (d) all other employees'. The content discusses measurement frameworks, self-identification practices, and high-level reporting on gender representation, but fails to disclose actual figures or breakdowns for this particular employee category. Although the retrieval results include keyword matches with moderate scores (up to 0.625), and some contextual relevance regarding gender and workforce diversity, none of the segments contain direct disclosure of the required quantitative metric. The absence of concrete data points means the disclosure does not meet even a minimal threshold for this SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P074_T000, P075_S005, P043_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a clear percentage breakdown of gender representation specifically for 'all other employees' (non-executive, non-managerial roles) to align with SASB metric requirements.
  - Include a dedicated workforce diversity table that separates data by gender, job level, and employee category to improve transparency and compliance.
  - Enhance disclosure by publishing annual workforce demographic data with self-identification rates to support the reliability of reported percentages.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (a) executive management (sasb_4_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While multiple segments reference diversity, inclusion, executive leadership, and representation—particularly in relation to objectives, governance oversight (e.g., Executive Committee and Board Remuneration Committee), and success measures—there is no explicit quantitative data provided on the percentage of two specific diversity groups represented within executive management. The content indicates that Macquarie sets diversity objectives, tracks representation as a success measure, and monitors progress at senior levels, including executive roles. However, actual metrics or percentages for two defined diversity groups (e.g., gender and ethnicity) in executive management are not disclosed in any of the retrieved segments. The keyword matches are relevant but largely contextual, with moderate match scores (mostly 0.625), indicating thematic relevance rather than precise metric reporting. No semantic retrieval results were included, which may suggest a lack of direct narrative discussion of the specific metric. Overall, while the framework for reporting exists, the specific data point required by the SASB metric is absent.
- **Evidence Segments**: P047_S004, P051_S015, P074_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose specific numerical data on the representation of at least two diversity groups (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity) within executive management roles.
  - Include a dedicated table or section in future reports that breaks down workforce composition by level and diversity dimensions, particularly for senior leadership and executive positions.
  - Enhance transparency by aligning disclosures directly with SASB metric requirements, ensuring both qualitative context and quantitative data are provided.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for(b) non-executive management (sasb_5_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While multiple segments reference diversity, inclusion, representation of under-represented groups, and leadership levels (including senior management), none provide specific quantitative data on the percentage of two diversity group representations within non-executive management. The content emphasizes objectives, principles, and high-level commitments to diversity and equity, particularly at senior leadership levels such as Executive Committee, Board, or Division Head levels. However, there is no explicit mention of non-executive management as a defined category, nor are there any numerical values or percentages reported for two distinct diversity groups (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity) in that specific managerial tier. The retrieval types are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (ranging from 0.333 to 0.556), indicating relevance to general themes but not precise metric alignment. There is an absence of structured data or direct disclosure matching the SASB metric's specificity and scope.
- **Evidence Segments**: P074_T000, P047_S004, P051_S015
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a clear breakdown of workforce composition by management level, specifically distinguishing non-executive management.
  - Report quantitative metrics on the representation of at least two defined diversity groups (e.g., gender, racial/ethnic minorities) within non-executive management roles.
  - Include year-on-year comparative data to demonstrate progress toward diversity objectives.
  - Align disclosures more precisely with SASB metric definitions by specifying the exact employee categories and diversity dimensions measured.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (c) professionals (sasb_6_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While multiple segments reference diversity, inclusion, representation, and related objectives—particularly in relation to under-represented groups, leadership accountability, and workforce composition—there is no explicit mention of quantitative data for the specific metric 'Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (c) professionals'. The document discusses diversity goals, success measures, and reporting frameworks (e.g., gender and cultural representation, DEI objectives for leaders), and indicates that workforce composition data is reported (Segment 3), but it does not provide actual percentages or figures for two defined diversity groups within the professional employee category. The retrieved segments are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (highest being 0.714), and while they confirm the existence of a reporting framework on diversity, they lack the specificity required for this SASB metric. The absence of a dedicated table or statement containing the precise metric value, combined with the general nature of the content, results in low disclosure quality.
- **Evidence Segments**: P074_T000, P047_S004, P047_S007
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Publish disaggregated workforce data by professional job category and two specified diversity dimensions (e.g., gender and ethnicity), as required by the SASB metric.
  - Include a dedicated table or chart in the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion section (pages 74–77) showing percentage representation of at least two diversity groups among professionals.
  - Enhance transparency by defining which diversity groups are tracked (e.g., women, racial/ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities) and align reporting with SASB’s industry-specific standards.
  - Improve metadata tagging to ensure high-priority metrics like this are clearly linked to both semantic and keyword retrieval systems for better auditability.

#### Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (d) all other employees  (sasb_7_Percentage_of_2_diversity_group_representation_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While several segments mention diversity, inclusion, representation, and employee groups—particularly in relation to under-represented groups and leadership levels—there is no specific quantitative data provided for the metric 'Percentage of (2) diversity group representation for (d) all other employees'. The content discusses diversity objectives, success measures, and general commitments (e.g., increasing diversity in talent pipelines and equitable opportunities), but does not disclose actual percentages or workforce composition data for two defined diversity groups across all non-executive or non-senior employee categories. Segments 1 and 2 reference diversity representation goals and reporting against objectives, but these are qualitative descriptions without numerical metrics. The remaining segments (3–5) are contextually related to employee engagement, volunteering, and organizational structure but do not pertain to diversity representation data. Despite high keyword relevance (e.g., 'diversity', 'representation', 'employee', 'group') and moderate-to-high match scores, the absence of measurable, disaggregated workforce data for two diversity groups among all other employees means the disclosure requirement for this SASB metric is not met.
- **Evidence Segments**: P074_T000, P047_S004, P080_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Publish a workforce diversity breakdown by at least two defined diversity groups (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity) for all non-executive or non-leadership employees.
  - Include tabular data showing percentage representation across job categories, particularly for 'all other employees' as defined by SASB standards.
  - Enhance transparency by aligning disclosures with SASB UTXS-00.4 or similar industry-specific guidelines for diversity metrics.
  - Report year-on-year trends in diversity representation to demonstrate progress toward stated objectives.

#### Revenue from (1) underwriting,(2) advisory
 incorporating integration of
environmental, social and governance
(ESG) factors, by industry (sasb_8_Revenue_from_1_underwriting2_advisory
_incorp)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention keywords related to the metric—such as 'advisory', 'investment', and 'banking'—and some reference Macquarie Capital and revenue drivers like advisory income (Segment 4), none of the provided content discloses actual revenue figures specifically broken down by industry for underwriting or advisory services that incorporate ESG factors. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.300–0.400), indicating only partial relevance, and no semantic matches were found, suggesting a lack of deeper contextual alignment with ESG-integrated revenue reporting. Furthermore, there is no explicit linkage between ESG integration and financial performance in underwriting or advisory activities across industries. The content primarily discusses organizational structure, strategic positioning, and high-level business outcomes without providing the granular, structured data required for this SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P109_S004, P131_S013, P008_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose revenue from underwriting and advisory services separately, with clear identification of transactions where ESG factors were formally integrated into decision-making.
  - Break down ESG-integrated revenue by industry sector (e.g., energy, transportation, technology) to meet SASB granularity expectations.
  - Include methodology notes explaining how ESG integration is defined and tracked within revenue-generating activities.
  - Enhance reporting transparency by aligning disclosures with SASB standards using consistent metrics and time-series data.

#### Revenue from(3) securitisation
transactions incorporating integration of
environmental, social and governance
(ESG) factors, by industry (sasb_9_Revenue_from3_securitisation
transactions_incorp)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments mention ESG factors in the context of investment processes (Segment 1) and describe various business segments such as asset management, banking, and capital markets (Segments 3, 4, 5), but none of them specifically disclose revenue from securitisation transactions that incorporate ESG factors by industry. While terms like 'investment', 'banking', 'ESG', and 'capital markets' are present, the retrieval is primarily keyword-based with low to moderate match scores (0.200–0.300), indicating weak relevance to the specific metric. There is no semantic or explicit reference to securitisation transactions involving ESG integration, nor any numerical data, breakdowns by industry, or structured disclosures related to this metric. The content fails to meet even basic disclosure requirements for the specified SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P063_S011, P125_S027, P173_S010
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide explicit quantitative disclosure of revenue generated from securitisation transactions that integrate ESG criteria, segmented by industry.
  - Clearly define what constitutes an 'ESG-integrated securitisation transaction' in line with SASB standards.
  - Include industry-specific breakdowns (e.g., energy, real estate, infrastructure) to meet the granularity required by the metric.
  - Enhance reporting with case examples or deal-level disclosures to substantiate claims of ESG integration in securitisation activities.

#### (1) Number of 
investments and loans incorporating integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, by industry (sasb_10_1_Number_of_
investments_and_loans_incorporating)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention investments, loans, and related financial performance (e.g., private credit portfolio growth of $A3.6 billion, references to green investments, and industry-specific activities in Banking and Financial Services or Macquarie Capital), none provide a quantified count or breakdown of the number of investments and loans that explicitly incorporate ESG factors by industry. The retrieved content is primarily financial in nature, discussing income drivers, market conditions, and performance metrics, but lacks any structured disclosure linking individual investments or loans to ESG integration. The tags indicate keyword-based matches (e.g., 'investments', 'loans', 'banking'), but these are contextually tied to financial results rather than ESG integration tracking. No semantic indication of ESG factor incorporation per investment or loan is present, and there is no tabular or textual data categorizing such exposures by industry as required by the SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P027_T000, P008_S003, P022_S007
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a clear quantitative count of investments and loans where ESG factors have been formally integrated into decision-making.
  - Break down the number of ESG-integrated investments and loans by industry sector (e.g., energy, agriculture, technology, financial services).
  - Include methodology or criteria used to determine whether an investment or loan incorporates ESG factors.
  - Enhance disclosures with dedicated tables or sections aligned with SASB standards, specifically addressing metric sasb_10_1_Number_of_investments_and_loans_incorporating.

#### (2) total value of 
investments and loans incorporating integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, by industry (sasb_11_2_total_value_of_
investments_and_loans_incorpor)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention terms related to 'investments', 'loans', and 'value'—and some provide quantitative figures such as gross carrying values, equity investments, and loans to associates and joint ventures—none of the retrieved content explicitly discloses the total value of investments and loans that incorporate the integration of ESG factors, segmented by industry. The metric in question requires a breakdown of financial exposure (investments and loans) where ESG considerations have been systematically integrated into decision-making, categorized across industries. While Segment 1 discusses green investments within Macquarie Asset Management and Macquarie Capital, referencing changes in performance due to green energy portfolios and environmental factors, it does not quantify the total value of such ESG-integrated activities by industry. The other segments focus on accounting treatments for fair value changes, impairment provisions, and classifications of financial assets without linking them to ESG integration. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.400), indicating only surface-level relevance rather than deep contextual alignment with ESG integration in lending and investment decisions. There is no consolidated or disaggregated data that maps to the SASB-defined metric requiring industry-level reporting of ESG-incorporated financial flows.
- **Evidence Segments**: P027_T000, P192_T001, P280_S009
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the total value of investments and loans where ESG factors have been formally integrated into underwriting, due diligence, or asset selection processes, clearly distinguishing them from conventional investments.
  - Break down the disclosed ESG-integrated investment and loan values by industry sectors (e.g., energy, finance, technology, agriculture) to meet SASB standard requirements.
  - Include a clear methodology explaining how ESG integration is defined and measured within investment and lending activities to enhance transparency and comparability.
  - Enhance semantic tagging and internal documentation practices to ensure ESG-related financial data is retrievable through both keyword and semantic search systems, improving disclosure visibility.

#### Total amount of monetary losses
as a result of legal proceedings associated with fraud, insider trading, antitrust, anticompetitive behaviour, market manipulation, malpractice, or other related financial industry laws or regulations 2 (sasb_13_Total_amount_of_monetary_losses
as_a_result_of_leg)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tags, there is no explicit disclosure of the 'Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with fraud, insider trading, antitrust, anticompetitive behaviour, market manipulation, malpractice, or other related financial industry laws or regulations'. While several segments mention concepts such as 'losses', 'amount', 'result', and 'associated', these terms appear in contexts unrelated to legal or regulatory financial misconduct. For example, Segment 1 discusses accounting judgements related to credit losses, impairment, and provisions but does not reference legal proceedings. Segment 3 refers to Expected Credit Loss (ECL) models and associated estimation uncertainty, which pertains to credit risk, not legal or compliance-related penalties. Segment 4 presents financial performance by business segment, including reversals of impairments and changes in income, but again lacks any mention of legal fines or settlements. Segment 5 touches on greenwashing as a legal and reputational risk and mentions internal standards and training, but no actual monetary losses from legal proceedings are disclosed. The keyword-based retrieval method and relatively low match scores (0.300–0.400) further indicate weak relevance between the search query and the content. No semantic references to litigation outcomes, regulatory penalties, or disclosed settlement amounts are present. Therefore, while some contextual keywords overlap, there is no substantive evidence of disclosure for this specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P167_S003, P274_S012, P288_S011
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose the total amount of monetary losses arising from legal proceedings related to financial industry violations, even if the amount is zero, to ensure transparency and compliance with SASB standards.
  - Include a dedicated section in the ESG or sustainability report that summarizes legal and regulatory settlements, particularly those tied to financial misconduct, to improve traceability and stakeholder confidence.
  - Enhance metadata tagging and indexing of disclosures related to legal risks and outcomes to improve retrieval accuracy for ESG metrics during audits or third-party assessments.

#### (1) Number of licensed 
employees and identified decision-makers with a record of investment-related investigations, consumer-initiated complaints, private civil litigations, or other regulatory proceedings 3 (sasb_15_1_Number_of_licensed_
employees_and_identified_d)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: After a comprehensive analysis of all retrieved segments and their associated tag information, there is no direct or indirect disclosure of the metric 'Number of licensed employees and identified decision-makers with a record of investment-related investigations, consumer-initiated complaints, private civil litigations, or other regulatory proceedings'. While several keywords such as 'identified', 'private', 'regulatory', 'record', and 'professional' appear in the text—triggering keyword-based retrieval with match scores ranging from 0.300 to 0.500—the context in which these terms are used is unrelated to employee disciplinary records or legal/regulatory actions against individuals. For example, 'private credit' and 'record raisings' refer to financial performance; 'identified under CPS 511' relates to remuneration regulations, not misconduct reporting; and references to 'risk professionals' or 'regulatory requirements' pertain to governance and compliance frameworks rather than incident tracking. None of the segments provide quantitative data or qualitative disclosures about employee histories involving investigations, complaints, litigation, or regulatory actions. The retrieval was primarily keyword-driven with moderate to low relevance scores, and no semantic alignment with the intended meaning of the metric was found. Therefore, the disclosure is absent.
- **Evidence Segments**: P027_T000, P110_T000, P022_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Establish a formal reporting mechanism to track and disclose the number of licensed employees and decision-makers involved in investment-related investigations, complaints, litigations, or regulatory proceedings.
  - Integrate this metric into the firm's annual compliance or ESG report with clear definitions, scope, and data collection protocols.
  - Enhance transparency by providing anonymized summaries of cases, outcomes, and remedial actions taken, while respecting privacy and legal constraints.

####  (2) percentage of licensed employees and identified decision-makers with a record of investment-related investigations, consumer-initiated complaints, private civil litigations, or other regulatory proceedings 3 (sasb_16__2_percentage_of_licensed_employees_and_identifi)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention related concepts such as 'identified decision-makers', 'regulatory proceedings', 'compliance', 'conduct risk', and 'professional conduct', none of the retrieved content provides quantitative or qualitative disclosure specifically addressing the percentage of licensed employees and identified decision-makers with a record of investment-related investigations, consumer complaints, private civil litigations, or other regulatory proceedings. The keyword matches (e.g., 'identified', 'with', 'regulatory', 'record', 'private') appear to stem from tangential discussions around remuneration frameworks, risk management, compliance culture, and business performance, but do not pertain directly to the metric in question. The retrieval types are all keyword-based with moderate scores (0.300–0.400), indicating weak relevance, and no semantic matches were found, further suggesting a lack of direct contextual alignment. There is no evidence of data aggregation, reporting, or monitoring related to employee disciplinary records or regulatory actions against licensed personnel.
- **Evidence Segments**: P027_T000, P110_T000, P022_S014
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Establish a formal reporting mechanism to track and disclose the percentage of licensed employees and key decision-makers involved in investment-related regulatory actions, complaints, or litigation.
  - Enhance ESG disclosures by integrating workforce integrity metrics into governance and compliance reporting frameworks.
  - Improve data collection systems to monitor regulatory histories of licensed personnel and include summary statistics in annual sustainability or responsibility reports.
  - Align future disclosures with SASB standards by explicitly addressing the specified metric with clear definitions, scope, and measurement methodology.

#### employees and identified decision-makers with a record of investment-related investigations, consumer-initiated complaints, private civil litigations, or other regulatory proceedings 3 (sasb_17_employees_and_identified_decision-makers_with_a_re)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention related concepts such as 'identified employees', 'regulatory requirements', 'compliance', 'conduct risk', and 'complaints', none of the provided content directly discloses data or information about employees or decision-makers who have a record of investment-related investigations, consumer-initiated complaints, private civil litigations, or other regulatory proceedings. The retrieved segments primarily focus on remuneration frameworks, performance evaluation criteria, risk management processes, and conduct risk controls. While terms like 'identified' (e.g., Material Risk Takers), 'regulatory', 'compliance', and 'record' appear in context, they are used in relation to governance, risk assessment, and incentive structures rather than disclosing actual records of legal, regulatory, or civil actions against individuals. The tag matches are based on keyword overlap rather than semantic relevance to the specific metric, and the matching scores are moderate to low (0.300–0.500), indicating weak alignment. There is no explicit mention of investigations, litigation history, complaint tracking, or disciplinary records for employees or decision-makers. Therefore, despite contextual proximity, there is no substantive disclosure of the required metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P110_T000, P027_T000, P123_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the number or status of employees and decision-makers involved in investment-related investigations, consumer complaints, civil litigations, or regulatory actions.
  - Disclose whether any current Executive KMPs or senior decision-makers have a history of regulatory sanctions or legal proceedings.
  - Enhance transparency by linking conduct incident records to individual accountability and decision-making roles.
  - Provide a summary of private civil litigation outcomes involving employees in investment functions over the reporting period.

#### Total amount of monetary losses as a
result of legal proceedings associated with
professional integrity, including duty of
care 4 (sasb_18_Total_amount_of_monetary_losses_as_a
result_of_leg)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While several retrieved segments mention related concepts such as legal proceedings, professional integrity, monetary amounts, and regulatory enforcement, none of them provide a quantified disclosure of the total amount of monetary losses resulting from legal proceedings associated with professional integrity, including duty of care. Segment 1 discusses potential civil claims and regulatory actions across multiple jurisdictions and mentions that provisions have been made for possible outcomes (including penalties, fines, and damages), but explicitly states that these matters are not expected to have a material impact and does not disclose any actual or aggregated monetary loss figure tied specifically to professional integrity or duty of care violations. The other segments reference governance, indemnification, director responsibilities, and risk oversight (Segments 3, 4, 5), which are contextually relevant to compliance and legal risk management, but do not report on realized monetary losses from legal proceedings. The keyword-based retrieval method and relatively low match scores (all ≤0.400) further suggest that the metric is not directly addressed in the document. There is no evidence of a specific numerical value, range, or even qualitative description of losses tied to this SASB metric. Therefore, while there is contextual discussion around legal and regulatory risks, there is no substantive disclosure of the required quantitative data.
- **Evidence Segments**: P201_S019, P009_S020, P038_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose the total monetary losses incurred during the reporting period from legal proceedings related to breaches of professional integrity, including duty of care, either as an aggregate figure or broken down by jurisdiction or case type.
  - Enhance transparency by providing a reconciliation of provisions recognized in financial statements against actual settlements or awards in such cases.
  - Clearly label disclosures to align with SASB metric codes and terminology to improve detectability through both keyword and semantic search methods.
  - Include forward-looking commentary on materiality assessments for ongoing or pending cases involving professional conduct, especially if potential liabilities exist beyond current provisions.

#### Global Systemically Important Bank (GSIB) 
score, by category 5 (sasb_20_Global_Systemically_Important_Bank_GSIB_
score_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments reference terms related to 'bank', 'global', 'risk', and 'systemic'—with keywords matching the metric's context such as systemic risk, risk management, and global banking operations—there is no explicit mention of the institution’s Global Systemically Important Bank (GSIB) score or its categorization under Basel III GSIB frameworks. The content discusses risk governance structures (e.g., Board Risk Committee, CRO confirmations on systemic concerns), regulatory engagement (e.g., APRA remediation), and business-level risk considerations, but none of these include quantitative or qualitative disclosures about GSIB assessment indicators such as size, interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity, or cross-jurisdictional activity that would determine a bank's GSIB status or score. The retrieval results are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.400–0.500), indicating only thematic relevance rather than direct disclosure. No semantic matches were retrieved, further suggesting absence of conceptual discussion around GSIB scoring. Therefore, while the organization demonstrates awareness of systemic and regulatory risk, it does not disclose its GSIB classification or related metrics.
- **Evidence Segments**: P107_S004, P027_T000, P036_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose the company's current GSIB status and category according to Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) standards.
  - Provide a breakdown of GSIB score components, including indicators such as size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness, substitutability, and complexity.
  - Include year-over-year trends in GSIB scores and any strategic actions taken to manage systemic importance.
  - Enhance transparency by explaining how GSIB-related risks are integrated into enterprise risk management and board oversight processes.

#### Percentage of total remuneration that is 
variable for Material Risk Takers (MRTs) 6 (sasb_22_Percentage_of_total_remuneration_that_is_
variable)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments discuss remuneration components, risk management, and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), none provide the specific quantitative data required for the metric 'Percentage of total remuneration that is variable for Material Risk Takers'. The documents describe structural aspects of variable pay (e.g., profit share, PSUs, deferral periods, clawback/malus), eligibility criteria, and governance frameworks, and explicitly mention MRTs in the context of role-based allowances. However, there is no explicit breakdown or calculation of the proportion of variable remuneration relative to total remuneration for the defined group of MRTs. The absence of numerical values, ratios, or percentages directly addressing this metric—despite relevant contextual information—means the disclosure is insufficient to meet the metric's requirements. Additionally, all retrieved segments are keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.500 or below), indicating proximity to the topic but not precise reporting of the metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P110_T000, P121_T003, P123_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose the average or median percentage of total remuneration that is variable for employees classified as Material Risk Takers.
  - Provide a breakdown of fixed vs. variable pay for MRTs by level or business unit to enhance transparency.
  - Include quantitative disclosures aligned with regulatory requirements such as CRD IV/CRR or CPS 511, which often mandate capped variable pay ratios for MRTs.
  - Explicitly define the population of MRTs and link their remuneration structure to the reported metrics.
  - Improve structured reporting using standardized templates to ensure key ESG/SASB metrics are clearly identifiable and quantifiable.

#### Percentage of variable remuneration of 
Material Risk Takers (MRTs) to which malus or clawback provisions were applied 7 (sasb_23_Percentage_of_variable_remuneration_of_
Material_R)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While the provided segments contain detailed information about the existence and scope of malus and clawback provisions for variable remuneration—particularly for Material Risk Takers (MRTs), Executive KMPs, and senior employees—there is no quantitative data disclosed regarding the actual percentage of variable remuneration to which malus or clawback provisions were applied during the reporting period. The content describes the policy framework (e.g., conditions under which malus/clawback can be applied, eligible employee groups, timeframes), but does not report any measured or calculated percentage. Multiple segments (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) retrieved via keyword matching with moderate scores (0.400–0.600) confirm the presence of structural disclosures but lack performance or outcome-based metrics. There is no mention of application frequency, number of cases, or financial impact that would enable calculation of the required SASB metric. As such, while the qualitative mechanisms are disclosed, the specific quantitative disclosure required by 'sasb_23_Percentage_of_variable_remuneration_of_Material_R' is absent.
- **Evidence Segments**: P121_T003, P110_T000, P121_T002
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose the actual percentage of variable remuneration of Material Risk Takers to which malus or clawback was applied in the reporting year.
  - Provide a breakdown of instances where malus or clawback was invoked, including number of employees affected and total amount recovered or reduced.
  - Explicitly map the disclosed policies to the SASB metric definition to ensure alignment with ESG reporting standards.
  - Include quantitative metrics in future reports to elevate disclosure quality from low to high.

#### Discussion of policies around supervision, 
control, and validation of traders’ pricing of Level 3 assets and liabilities (sasb_24_Discussion_of_policies_around_supervision_
contro)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention keywords related to the metric—such as 'policies', 'control', 'employee', and 'level'—the retrieved content does not specifically address policies around supervision, control, and validation of traders’ pricing of Level 3 assets and liabilities. The matching segments are primarily retrieved via keyword matching with low match scores (all at 0.300–0.400), indicating weak relevance. Segment 1 is a table of contents with no substantive discussion. Segment 3 discusses conduct risk policies and controls but in a general governance context, not specific to trader pricing or Level 3 valuations. Segments 4 and 5 touch on workforce structure and remuneration frameworks involving risk and control staff, but do not describe supervisory mechanisms for valuation practices. There is no semantic indication that Macquarie discloses formal processes for overseeing how traders price Level 3 instruments, which are subject to significant judgment and require robust validation controls under fair value accounting standards (e.g., IFRS 13). The absence of explicit discussion on independent price verification, challenge processes, or oversight committees for Level 3 pricing indicates non-disclosure.
- **Evidence Segments**: P160_S000, P011_S003, P072_S010
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose the existence and structure of policies governing the supervision and validation of trader pricing for Level 3 assets and liabilities.
  - Describe the roles of control functions (e.g., Valuation Committees, Risk Management, Internal Audit) in reviewing and challenging Level 3 valuations.
  - Include information on escalation processes, use of independent pricing sources, and segregation of duties between traders and valuation controllers.
  - Enhance transparency by providing examples or case studies of how pricing challenges were resolved during the reporting period.

#### (1) Number  of  (a) underwriting,(b) advisory (sasb_25_1_Number__of__a_underwritingb_advisory)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although the term 'advisory' appears multiple times across several segments, and 'number' is mentioned in two instances, there is no explicit disclosure of quantitative data for the metric 'Number of (a) underwriting, (b) advisory'. The retrieved segments are primarily keyword-based matches with moderate to low match scores (0.333–0.667), indicating weak relevance. The content discusses Macquarie's risk management framework, executive experience, business offerings, and financial performance—including references to advisory services and income—but does not provide any count or numerical value related to the number of underwriting or advisory engagements. No semantic evidence suggests implied or indirect reporting of this metric either. Therefore, despite contextual mentions of 'advisory', the specific metric required is not disclosed.
- **Evidence Segments**: P082_S016, P098_S012, P010_S008
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the total number of underwriting and advisory transactions completed during the reporting period.
  - Include a dedicated ESG or sustainability disclosure section with SASB-aligned metrics, ensuring coverage of sasb_25_1_Number__of__a_underwritingb_advisory.
  - Enhance metadata tagging and retrieval accuracy by improving alignment between reported data and keyword indexing for auditability.

#### (1) Number of  (c) securitisation transactions8 (sasb_26_1_Number_of__c_securitisation_transactions8)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments were retrieved using keyword matching (primarily based on the terms 'number' and 'securitisation'), none of them provide actual data or explicit disclosure related to the metric 'Number of (c) securitisation transactions8'. Segment 1 contains a detailed table with various financial metrics such as earnings per share, market capitalization, return on equity, and mentions 'securitisation SPVs' in the context of loan assets, but does not report any count or number of securitisation transactions. The other segments (2–5) mention numerical values or financial performance drivers but are unrelated to securitisation transaction volumes. The matched keywords appear to have triggered retrieval due to partial term overlap (e.g., 'number', 'securitisation'), but no direct or indirect quantitative disclosure of the specified metric is present. Furthermore, all retrieval types are keyword-based with moderate to low match scores (highest being 0.667), indicating weak relevance. There is no semantic-level contextual support for the specific metric. Therefore, the disclosure is absent.
- **Evidence Segments**: P299_T002, P023_S019, P027_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the number of securitisation transactions in a dedicated line item within financial or risk disclosures.
  - Ensure disclosures align with SASB standards by including both qualitative context and quantitative metrics for securitisation activities.
  - Improve tagging and structuring of data tables to enhance semantic searchability for ESG compliance metrics.

#### (2) value of (a) underwriting,(b) advisory (sasb_27_2_value_of_a_underwritingb_advisory)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although the keyword 'advisory' appears in Segment 4 and the term 'value' is mentioned in multiple segments, none of the retrieved content provides quantitative or qualitative disclosure specifically related to the metric 'value of (a) underwriting, (b) advisory'. The mentions of 'advisory' are limited to a general reference to 'lower advisory income' within Macquarie Capital’s financial performance, without breaking down the actual value of advisory services. Similarly, references to 'value' are used in broad, non-specific contexts such as creating value for stakeholders, which does not equate to disclosing the financial value of underwriting or advisory activities. All retrieval matches are based on keyword searches with low match scores (0.333), and no semantic context directly linking to the metric's intended disclosure was found. There is no mention of underwriting revenue or fees, nor any numerical data that could be interpreted as the value of these services.
- **Evidence Segments**: P008_S005, P009_S002, P009_S004
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide explicit financial figures for underwriting and advisory revenues, clearly labeled and aligned with SASB metric requirements.
  - Ensure disclosures include both absolute values and, where relevant, year-on-year comparisons to enhance transparency.
  - Use structured tagging and semantic indexing to improve retrieval accuracy for ESG metrics, ensuring key terms like 'underwriting' and 'advisory income' are contextually linked to financial data.

#### (1) Number of proprietary 
investments and loans by sector9 (sasb_29_1_Number_of_proprietary_
investments_and_loans_b)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention terms related to 'investments' and 'loans'—such as 'private credit portfolio', 'loan assets', 'financial investments', and 'number of investments'—none of the retrieved content provides a structured, quantified breakdown of proprietary investments and loans by sector as required by the metric. The mentions are qualitative or refer to financial performance drivers (e.g., income changes due to investment activity) rather than disclosing the actual number or count of investments and loans distributed across sectors. Segment 1 includes high-level business unit performance but lacks enumeration of individual investments or loans per sector. Segments 5 references aggregate loan asset values and growth percentages, but these are monetary values, not counts of transactions or holdings. The retrieval type for all segments is keyword-based with moderate to low match scores (0.400–0.600), indicating weak contextual alignment with the intended metric. There is no evidence of a tabular or categorical listing of proprietary investments and loans by sector, which is essential for SASB-aligned disclosure under this metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P027_T000, P027_S008, P028_S028
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a clear table or list enumerating the number of proprietary investments and loans categorized by sector (e.g., energy, financial services, commodities, real estate).
  - Differentiate between types of investments (equity, debt, loans) and specify whether they are active, exited, or under management.
  - Include quantitative counts (e.g., '120 proprietary loans in renewable energy sector') rather than only referencing financial values or performance impacts.
  - Align disclosures with SASB standards by structuring data to reflect both volume and sectoral exposure for proprietary activities.

#### (1) Number of market making 
transactions in (a) fixed income, (b) equity, (c) currency, (d) derivatives, and (e) commodity products (sasb_31_1_Number_of_market_making_
transactions_in_a_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments reference the business activities and market presence of Macquarie's Commodities and Global Markets (CGM) and Financial Markets divisions—mentioning fixed income, equity, currency, derivatives, and commodity products—there is no explicit quantitative or qualitative disclosure of the actual number of market-making transactions across these product categories. The retrieved content highlights financial performance drivers (e.g., trading income, client hedging activity), business recognition (e.g., awards, rankings), and operational focus areas, but none report transaction volume metrics. Segments were retrieved primarily via keyword matching (e.g., 'number', 'market', 'derivatives', 'commodity'), yet the context does not contain data on transaction counts. The absence of any numerical figures or references to transaction volumes, combined with the low-to-moderate match scores and generic keyword-based relevance, indicates that the company has not disclosed this specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P027_T000, P023_S006, P023_S019
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Disclose the total number of market-making transactions segmented by product type: (a) fixed income, (b) equity, (c) currency, (d) derivatives, and (e) commodity products, as required by SASB standard sasb_31_1_Number_of_market_making_transactions_in_a_f.
  - Provide time-series data for comparative analysis across reporting periods to enhance transparency and stakeholder understanding.
  - Include methodological notes explaining how transactions are defined and counted (e.g., executed trades, client-initiated vs. proprietary), ensuring consistency and auditability.

####  (2) value of market making 
transactions in (a) fixed income (sasb_32__2_value_of_market_making_
transactions_in_a_f)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention keywords related to the metric—such as 'market,' 'transactions,' 'fixed income,' and 'income'—none of them provide actual quantitative or qualitative disclosure specifically addressing the 'value of market making transactions in fixed income.' The retrieved segments are primarily discussing fair value recognition, day one profit or loss, and general market risk exposures, but do not isolate or report data on market-making activities in the fixed income segment. The matching keywords appear in broad accounting policy or business activity descriptions (Retrieval Type: keyword, Match Scores: 0.500–0.667), indicating only partial topical relevance without substantive disclosure. There is no evidence of a reported figure, narrative explanation, or breakdown related to this specific SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P263_S006, P278_S006, P023_S006
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose the total value of market making transactions in fixed income instruments, segmented by relevant categories (e.g., government bonds, corporate debt, etc.), to meet SASB standards.
  - Include a dedicated section in the ESG or financial reporting that quantifies trading volumes or values attributable to market-making activities in fixed income markets.
  - Enhance disclosure granularity by distinguishing between principal and agency transactions, and providing context on how these activities contribute to liquidity provision and market stability.

####  (2) value of market making 
transactions in (b) equity, (sasb_33__2_value_of_market_making_
transactions_in_b_e)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although multiple segments mention keywords related to the metric—such as 'equity', 'market', 'transactions', and 'value'—none of them provide a direct or quantifiable disclosure of the specific SASB metric 'value of market making transactions in equity'. The retrieved segments are primarily contextual, discussing general market conditions (Segment 1), valuation methods for unlisted securities (Segment 2), ESR policy covering equity-related transactions (Segment 3), exposure disclosures including equity investments (Segment 4), and remuneration structures involving equity (Segment 5). However, none report actual transaction volume or value metrics related to equity market making activities. The keyword matches have high scores (0.800) but stem from generic co-occurrence rather than substantive reporting of the metric. There is no numerical data, time-series information, or explicit reference to market making as a trading activity in the equity segment. The retrieval type is keyword-based, and while relevant terms appear, they lack semantic alignment with the intended meaning of the SASB metric, indicating absence of targeted disclosure.
- **Evidence Segments**: P025_S008, P265_S008, P056_S015
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly disclose the annual or quarterly value of market making transactions in equity instruments, segmented by region or business unit if applicable.
  - Align disclosures with SASB standards by defining the scope of 'market making transactions' and specifying whether the reported value includes principal transactions, client facilitation, or proprietary trading.
  - Include quantitative metrics in financial or operational sections of the report, supported by clear definitions and methodologies for calculation.
  - Enhance semantic relevance by using standardized terminology such as 'market making', 'equity trading volume', or 'principal transaction value' in contextually accurate sections.

####  (2) value of market making 
transactions in  (c) currency. (sasb_34__2_value_of_market_making_
transactions_in__c_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While multiple segments mention keywords related to 'value', 'market', and 'transactions', none of them specifically disclose or quantify the 'value of market making transactions in currency' as defined by the SASB metric (sasb_34__2_value_of_market_making_transactions_in__c_). The retrieved segments are primarily focused on accounting policies, fair value measurement techniques, judgment areas in financial reporting, and general market influences on Macquarie’s businesses. Although terms like 'fair value', 'market transactions', and 'trading activities' appear, they are discussed in the context of valuation methodologies, impairment, hedge accounting, or SPPI assessments—not in relation to actual reported values of market-making transactions conducted in a specific currency. Furthermore, all segments were retrieved via keyword matching with moderate scores (0.600), indicating only surface-level relevance rather than deep contextual alignment with the target ESG metric. There is no evidence of structured, quantitative disclosure around market-making transaction volumes or values broken down by currency, which is essential for compliance with this SASB metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P025_S008, P167_S003, P259_S004
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the total value of market-making transactions, segmented by major currency, in annual sustainability or ESG reports.
  - Align disclosures with SASB standards by defining the scope, methodology, and time period for measuring market-making transaction values.
  - Include both qualitative explanations and quantitative data to enhance transparency and stakeholder understanding.
  - Ensure that future disclosures are contextually rich and semantically linked to ESG metrics, improving retrieval accuracy and auditability.

####  (2) value of market making 
transactions in (d) derivatives (sasb_35__2_value_of_market_making_
transactions_in_d_d)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: Although several segments mention keywords related to the metric—such as 'value', 'market', 'derivatives', and 'transactions'—none of them explicitly disclose or quantify the specific value of market making transactions in derivatives. The retrieved segments are primarily focused on valuation methodologies (e.g., fair value measurement, use of valuation techniques when market quotes are unavailable), risk management frameworks (e.g., Value-at-Risk limits, contingent loss scenarios), or general market influences on transaction volumes and asset values. While Segment 4 references gains/losses from trading assets and derivatives, it does not isolate or report the 'value of market making transactions in derivatives' as a distinct metric. The matching keywords appear in contexts of accounting policies, risk controls, or broad financial performance drivers rather than actual disclosure of the targeted quantitative metric. Furthermore, all high-relevance matches (highest match score 0.800) are based on keyword retrieval, not semantic understanding indicating deeper contextual relevance, suggesting surface-level keyword overlap without substantive content alignment. There is no evidence of structured reporting for the SASB-defined metric sasb_35__2_value_of_market_making_transactions_in_d_d.
- **Evidence Segments**: P259_S004, P025_S008, P167_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the total value of market making transactions in derivatives, disaggregated by type if necessary, in line with SASB standards.
  - Enhance transparency by including this metric in financial or ESG disclosures with clear definitions and measurement methodologies.
  - Ensure future reports include dedicated sections for market-making activities in derivatives to improve keyword and semantic retrieval accuracy.

####  (2) value of market making 
transactions in (e) commodity products (sasb_36__2_value_of_market_making_
transactions_in_e_c)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: While several segments mention related concepts such as 'commodity products,' 'market making,' 'trading transactions,' and 'fair value,' none explicitly disclose the specific metric 'value of market making transactions in commodity products.' The retrieved segments primarily discuss valuation methodologies (e.g., fair value measurement, pricing models, commodity margin curves), general trading activities, or income drivers within Commodities and Global Markets (CGM), but do not isolate or quantify market-making transactions specifically. Segments 2 and 5 include financial data in tables, but these relate to broader product categories or income components without breaking out market-making activity. The keyword-based retrieval with moderate match scores (0.667–0.500) indicates thematic relevance rather than direct disclosure. There is no semantic indication of a structured or explicit report on the volume or value of market-making transactions in commodity products, which is required under SASB standards for this metric.
- **Evidence Segments**: P259_S004, P264_T000, P265_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly report the total value of market-making transactions in commodity products, segmented by region or commodity type if applicable.
  - Clarify whether 'trading income' or 'inventory management income' includes market-making activities and provide a reconciliation if possible.
  - Enhance disclosures around principal trading and market-making roles in commodity derivatives, distinguishing them from proprietary trading or risk management activities.
  - Include quantitative metrics aligned with SASB guidelines, such as gross/notional value or revenue derived from market-making in commodity products.

### ⚠️ Partially Disclosed

#### Description of approach to incorporation 
of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investment banking and brokerage activities (sasb_12_Description_of_approach_to_incorporation_
of_envir)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments collectively confirm that Macquarie has a defined approach to incorporating ESG factors, particularly emphasizing governance structures and material focus areas relevant to its operations. The Board and management recognize the importance of ESG practices across environmental, social, and governance dimensions, and there is mention of an ESG framework approved by the Board with implementation led by management. The ESG approach is structured around eight material focus areas, including environmental and social risk management, climate change, financing, and business conduct, which indicates a strategic integration of ESG into core operations. However, while these disclosures reflect a general commitment and high-level structure, they lack specific details on how ESG factors are systematically incorporated into investment banking and brokerage activities—such as integration in deal screening, due diligence, client advisory processes, or product design. Most retrieved segments were identified via keyword matching with moderate scores (0.400–0.500), suggesting relevance but not deep contextual alignment with the metric's focus on investment banking and brokerage. There is no explicit description of policies, tools, or methodologies used to embed ESG considerations into financial advisory or brokerage services, limiting the depth of disclosure.
- **Evidence Segments**: P053_S003, P013_T000, P051_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide specific examples or case studies showing how ESG factors are integrated into investment banking and brokerage decision-making processes.
  - Detail the tools, frameworks, or assessment methodologies used to evaluate ESG risks and opportunities in client engagements or transactions.
  - Clarify whether ESG criteria are embedded in product development, advisory services, or due diligence procedures within the investment banking division.
  - Enhance transparency by disclosing any ESG-related training for investment bankers or brokers, or the use of ESG key performance indicators in performance evaluations.

#### Description of whistleblower policies and 
procedures (sasb_14_Description_of_whistleblower_policies_and_
procedu)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'Description of whistleblower policies and procedures' is indirectly addressed across multiple segments, though no single section provides a dedicated, comprehensive description of formal whistleblower policies and procedures. Segment 1 explicitly mentions 'whistleblower training' as part of board workshops on governance and risk issues, indicating awareness and integration of whistleblower topics at the governance level. Segments 3 and 4 reference broader compliance and policy frameworks, including fostering environments where staff feel comfortable raising concerns and upholding the Code of Conduct, which aligns with the underlying intent of whistleblower protections. Additionally, the mention of 'policies and procedures' in Segment 3 within the context of employee conduct and compliance suggests systemic expectations for issue escalation. However, there is no explicit disclosure detailing the structure, channels, confidentiality measures, or procedural safeguards of the whistleblower mechanism itself. The retrieval types are primarily keyword-based with moderate match scores (0.500 and 0.333), indicating relevance but not strong thematic centrality. While the presence of related governance and ethical culture elements supports partial disclosure, the lack of direct, detailed procedural information limits the completeness of the disclosure.
- **Evidence Segments**: P037_S012, P044_T000, P112_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a dedicated section describing the organization’s whistleblower policy, including reporting mechanisms, anonymity provisions, anti-retaliation measures, and case management procedures.
  - Clarify how whistleblower reports are reviewed, escalated, and acted upon, particularly in relation to board oversight and committee responsibilities.
  - Include metrics or examples on whistleblower report volume, resolution rates, or outcomes to enhance transparency and demonstrate effectiveness.

#### Description of approach to ensuring professional integrity, including duty of care (sasb_19_Description_of_approach_to_ensuring_professional_i)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The provided segments collectively indicate that Macquarie has a structured and governance-driven approach to ensuring professional integrity, including elements related to duty of care. While no single segment explicitly uses the exact phrase 'duty of care' in the context of professional integrity, multiple high-relevance keyword-matched segments (all with a match score of 0.375) reference key components of the metric: 'approach', 'professional', 'ensuring', and 'including'. Segment 2 outlines Board oversight of professional conduct, cultural standards, risk management, and employee training—core aspects of maintaining professional integrity. Segment 5 details a robust risk management framework emphasizing professional judgment, independent review, and accountability, which supports ethical and responsible decision-making. Segment 4 references mandatory compliance training for employees and board directors on anti-bribery and corruption, reinforcing a culture of integrity. Segment 1 mentions a Director’s role in governance and compliance, indirectly supporting oversight mechanisms tied to professional standards. However, the disclosure lacks an explicit, consolidated description of the organization's overall approach to ensuring professional integrity, particularly with direct articulation of 'duty of care' as a principle or policy. The information is dispersed across governance, risk, and training contexts without a unified narrative directly addressing the metric. Hence, while relevant content exists, it is implicit and fragmented rather than comprehensive and targeted.
- **Evidence Segments**: P009_S020, P038_T000, P071_S003
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a dedicated section explicitly describing the company's approach to ensuring professional integrity, including a clear statement on duty of care for clients, shareholders, and stakeholders.
  - Consolidate and strengthen narrative disclosures around ethical standards, codes of conduct, and professional accountability frameworks across all levels of the organization.
  - Include specific policies or governance documents (e.g., Code of Conduct, Professional Standards Framework) that formalize expectations around integrity and duty of care.

#### Description of approach to integrate results of mandatory and voluntary stress tests into capital adequacy planning, longterm corporate strategy, and other business activities (sasb_21_Description_of_approach_to_integrate_results_of_ma)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric requests disclosure on the approach to integrating results from mandatory and voluntary stress tests into capital adequacy planning, long-term corporate strategy, and other business activities. Among the retrieved segments, Segment 1 provides the most relevant and substantive information, explicitly stating that stress testing is integrated into Macquarie’s risk management framework and directly informs the Annual Strategy Review, business planning, risk tolerance calibration, and assessment of alignment with risk appetite. This indicates a clear linkage between stress test outcomes and strategic and financial planning processes, which partially addresses the integration aspect of the metric. However, the document does not specify whether these stress tests are mandatory or voluntary, nor does it detail how results specifically inform capital adequacy planning—a core component of the metric. While terms like 'capital', 'planning', and 'management' appear in other segments (Segments 2–5), these references are contextually unrelated to stress testing or capital planning, serving instead to describe conduct risk, governance, WHS policy, or organizational structure. These lower-scoring keyword matches (0.300–0.400) do not contribute meaningful evidence. The primary support comes from Segment 1, which has a moderate match score (0.500) and was retrieved via keyword search, indicating only partial semantic alignment. Overall, while there is evidence of integration into strategy and planning, the lack of specificity regarding capital adequacy and classification of stress tests limits the completeness of the disclosure.
- **Evidence Segments**: P084_S009, P085_S002, P027_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly distinguish between mandatory and voluntary stress tests and describe how each type influences decision-making.
  - Detail how stress test results are incorporated into capital adequacy assessments, including any quantitative or qualitative adjustments made to capital planning.
  - Provide examples of past instances where stress test outcomes led to changes in strategy, capital allocation, or risk appetite settings.
  - Enhance transparency by outlining governance mechanisms overseeing the integration of stress testing into strategic and financial planning.

#### (2) value of (c) (c) securitisation transactions8 (sasb_28_2_value_of_c_c_securitisation_transactions8)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'value of (c) securitisation transactions' is partially addressed in the provided segments, with the most relevant information appearing in Segment 1, which reports the total size of unconsolidated securitisation entities (SEs) as $74,580 million (2023: $44,114 million). This figure represents the exposure related to securitisation and is based on key valuation metrics such as total assets, outstanding notional of issued notes, or principal liabilities—aligning closely with the intent of the SASB metric. The keyword retrieval type and moderate match score (0.667) for this segment indicate a direct but not perfect alignment with the query. Segment 2 contains additional context involving securitisation vehicles and collateral values ($19,252 million and $11,870 million held by Consolidated SEs), but these figures pertain more to asset classification and repledging activities rather than the overall value of securitisation transactions. The remaining segments mention 'value' in a general qualitative sense (e.g., shareholder value, director contributions) and are irrelevant to the quantitative disclosure of securitisation transaction volume. While the core data point is present, the lack of explicit labelling as 'securitisation transaction value' and absence of breakdowns required by SASB standards (e.g., types of securitisations, risk retention, credit enhancements) limits the completeness and precision of the disclosure.
- **Evidence Segments**: P225_S018, P268_S020, P008_S005
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Explicitly label and quantify 'value of securitisation transactions' in line with SASB reporting standards to improve clarity and comparability.
  - Provide a breakdown of securitisation transactions by type (e.g., mortgage-backed, asset-backed), including details on risk retention, credit enhancements, and off-balance-sheet treatment.
  - Improve metadata tagging and indexing to ensure higher match scores for ESG-related queries, particularly distinguishing financial from qualitative uses of terms like 'value'.

#### (2)value of proprietary 
investments and loans by sector9 (sasb_30_2value_of_proprietary_
investments_and_loans_by_)
- **Analysis Reasoning**: The metric 'value of proprietary investments and loans by sector' is partially addressed across multiple segments, primarily through financial data related to loan assets, financial investments, and equity/debt holdings by business segment. Segment 1 provides qualitative and quantitative insights into proprietary investment and lending activities within Macquarie Capital, Macquarie Asset Management (MAM), Banking and Financial Services (BFS), and Commodities and Global Markets (CGM), including year-on-year changes and drivers such as private credit growth and green energy investments. This offers a sector-level breakdown of performance linked to underlying investments and loans, though not explicitly aggregated as total values by sector. Segments 2, 4, and 5 provide balance sheet-level figures for loan assets ($A176.4 billion), financial investments ($A24.4 billion), and loans/equity in associates and joint ventures, which are relevant components of proprietary investments. However, these values are not clearly categorized under standardized sectors or labeled as 'proprietary' with full transparency on scope. The absence of a dedicated table or explicit reconciliation of proprietary investments and loans by sector—combined with moderate keyword-based retrieval scores (0.400) and lack of high-confidence semantic matches—limits the completeness and precision of disclosure. While material data points exist, they are dispersed and require inference rather than being presented directly in alignment with the SASB metric definition.
- **Evidence Segments**: P027_T000, P030_S015, P171_T000
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Provide a consolidated table disclosing the total value of proprietary investments and loans broken down by sector (e.g., energy, finance, infrastructure, real estate) in line with SASB reporting standards.
  - Explicitly define what constitutes 'proprietary investments and loans' within the organization, distinguishing them from other financial assets to improve clarity and comparability.
  - Enhance disclosure by including both carrying values and risk exposure metrics (e.g., credit quality, geographic distribution) for each sectoral category.
  - Use consistent terminology and direct references to SASB metric codes to strengthen traceability and auditability of ESG disclosures.

## Improvement Recommendations Summary

Based on the analysis results, it is recommended to prioritize improvements in the following areas:
1. For undisclosed metrics, recommend adding relevant content in the next report
2. For partially disclosed metrics, recommend providing more detailed quantitative data
