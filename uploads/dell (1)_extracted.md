A message from our Chairman and CEO

---
**P004_S001**

A lot has changed in the 40 years since I first launched Dell from a University of Texas dorm room, but what hasn’t changed is our commitment to creating technology that drives human progress. In fact, our mission is more powerful and important than ever.

---
**P004_S002**

Sustainability and ESG commitments are now widely recognized as business imperatives that impact everything from supplier decisions to business strategy. At Dell, we are both meeting our goals and helping customers meet theirs.

---
**P004_S003**

From the PC to the internet to the cloud, we’ve helped customers put their data to work to drive incredible outcomes. Now, with generative AI it feels like the last few decades have just been the pregame show. AI will revolutionize how we live and work, and it will drive unprecedented advances across every domain of human endeavor. From education to healthcare to physics, AI will help deliver radical progress and productivity.

---
**P004_S004**

In the following report, we hold ourselves accountable and share progress against our commitment to create positive business, social and environmental impact. Dell Technologies is rooted in innovation and progress, and this brings exciting opportunities for collaboration across our ecosystem of customers, partners and team members. Together, we can realize our greatest ambitions and do it responsibly.

---
**P004_S005**

We’re here to support you and are grateful for the opportunity to partner with you. “

---
**P004_S006**

We need to work together to ensure AI lives up to its potential by encouraging responsible use and ensuring its application is as beneficial to people and our planet as possible.

---
**P004_S007**

We need to work together to ensure AI lives up to its potential by encouraging responsible use and ensuring its application is as beneficial to people and our planet as possible. The evolving regulatory environment is on the minds of our customers, partners, suppliers and investors.

World Economic Forum (WEF) Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics (SCM)

---
**P014_S003**

ESG reporting is rapidly evolving with the growing adoption of the International Sustainability Standards Board’s (ISSB) reporting standards globally, transposition of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in European Union member countries and development of other regional and national requirements around the world. Dell currently reports on ESG in its financial statements; however, these new or evolving regulations require expanded reporting. We are actively preparing for these comprehensive and granular disclosures covering a broad range of sustainability topics.

---
**P014_S004**

Dell, alongside 25 other companies, was one of the initial signatories of the initiative by the WEF to align and focus corporate ESG disclosures. To meet this commitment, Dell reports on the WEF framework’s core Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.

**P014_S005**

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

---
**P014_S006**

We publish disclosures referencing the GRI standards, emphasizing the issues and indicators that are most relevant to our business and our stakeholders. GRI standards enhance the comparability and quality of information on economic, environmental and social impacts (positive and negative) organizations have. They also create a common language to communicate that information to stakeholders.

---
**P014_S007**

We believe transparent ESG reporting is a business imperative, which is why we focus on the metrics that matter most to our stakeholders.

---
**P014_S008**

We welcome the standardization, simplification and harmonization of international reporting standards, and we are committed to driving meaningful impact and transparently disclosing our progress. Our approach to disclosure is informed by global standards and frameworks including those outlined below, and we continue monitoring and preparing for the evolving reporting landscape.

Scope 1 and 2 emissions account for a small share of our total footprint and represent the emissions in our direct control. Here we focus on emissions reductions in operations, including purchased energy. In FY24, scope 1 and scope 2 (market-based) emissions accounted for 172,400 MT CO2e. We have reported using the market-based methodology since establishing a baseline in FY20.4

---
**P019_S003**

By 2030, we will reduce scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50%

---
**P019_S004**

Scope 1 includes direct emissions from Dell-owned and -controlled resources. Our main sources of scope 1 emissions include transportation (company vehicles and aircraft), fuel use, back-up generators, natural gas use, refrigerant leakage from Dell facilities, mobile sources and offices.5

---
**P019_S005**

**P019_S006**

KEY DRIVER

---
**P019_S007**

We use energy to operate office and data center equipment, heat and cool our buildings and operate a small fleet of on-site security and maintenance vehicles. In addition to facility operations, our total energy consumption includes the estimated fuel used in vehicles leased by Dell. We maintain our ISO 50001 certification in Dell-owned manufacturing facilities through our commitment to efficient energy systems management.

---
**P019_S008**

Scope 2 includes indirect emissions related to the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling. Our main sources of scope 2 emissions are from electricity purchased for our facilities.

---
**P019_S009**

By 2030, we will source 75% of electricity from renewable sources across all Dell Technologies facilities — and 100% by 2040

Scope 3 emissions

---
**P020_S001**

Category 11 includes emissions from the use of sold products and accounted for 11,473,600 MT CO2e in FY24. This category contains commercial and consumer products including desktops, notebooks, displays, docking stations, servers, storage and networking systems. Customer use of our data center server products had the largest impact on our scope 3 category 11 emissions and many of our innovations involved product energy efficiencies for data center hardware and software solutions.

---
**P020_S002**

KEY DRIVER

---
**P020_S003**

Scope 3 includes indirect emissions from upstream and downstream sources in our value chain. We identify scope 3 emissions sources in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard and perform extensive data collection for reporting requirements. We report emissions from our most significant scope 3 categories: purchased goods and services, upstream transportation, market-based energy activities and from the use of sold products. We also report emissions from business travel.

---
**P020_S004**

By 2030, we will reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions associated with the use of sold products by 30%

---
**P020_S005**

The amount of product that we ship is a large factor on our category 11 emissions. Also, emissions from the use of sold products contain several levers we have varying influence over, which can make year-over-year trends non-linear.7 Examples of levers in category 11 we have lower influence over are projected power consumption changes or the public grid energy mix. We continue to develop and implement initiatives where we have influence to reduce lever-type impacts on our category 11 emissions. Examples of levers we have higher influence on are product efficiency designs and telemetry sourced from customer usage profiles. KEY DRIVER

---
**P020_S006**

Scope 3 emissions make up the largest portion of our Dell GHG inventory. Within scope 3, emissions that are associated with the goods and services we purchased (category 1) and those associated with the use of our sold products (category 11) are the largest contributors.6 We have the largest opportunity for emissions reduction in these categories and each are directly associated with a climate action key driver.

---
**P020_S007**

Category 1 includes emissions from purchased goods and services. As done in our previous ESG reports, we provide scope 3 category 1 emissions with a one-year lag given the timeline of suppliers reporting their emissions data. For FY23, we reported our scope 3 category 1 emissions as 18,238,800 MT CO2e. This is a part of the dataset used to calculate the Dell GHG inventory.

Product carbon footprint

---
**P021_S001**

PAIA is commonly used throughout the consumer products industry. At Dell, we use PAIA for servers, storage, networking and legacy client products built prior to CY24. We will continue to use PAIA for infrastructure solutions group (ISG) servers, storage and networking client products.

---
**P021_S002**

The next step in our PCF calculation journey has been our development of the Dell PCF Calculator, which we have first applied to commercial client products. Several scope 3 emissions categories align with PCF data, including purchased goods and services, transportation and distribution and use of sold products.

---
**P021_S003**

Product carbon footprint (PCF) is the aggregate of manufacturing, transport and usage emissions plus those related to end-of-life management. PCFs provide customers with insights for more informed purchasing decisions. We employ two methodologies to capture end-to-end PCF impact across our product portfolio: Product Attribute to Impact Algorithm (PAIA) and the Dell PCF Calculator.8

---
**P021_S004**

Through our assessments and insights, we aim to reduce the carbon footprint of our products and solutions without compromising performance. We focus on reducing PCFs in four stages of the product lifecycle:

---
**P021_S005**

Product energy efficiency

---
**P021_S006**

Eco label standards

---
**P021_S007**

• Manufacturing: We actively reduce emissions from the start by using recycled, renewable and low-emissions materials.

---
**P021_S008**

We adhere to international eco label standards that guide our industry in areas of climate, circularity, transportation and energy efficiency. Eco labels help us build trust through third-party validations and make it easier for customers and partners to identify our most sustainable products.

---
**P021_S009**

We participate in the Global Electronics Council EPEAT eco-labeling program where over 330 of our products are EPEAT-registered and more than half of thoseare EPEAT gold. EPEAT has a range of criteria for products to earn its label. EPEAT also launched a Climate+ designation specifically for products that meet stringent climate-related criteria. The EPEAT Climate+ designation assures customers their purchases have limited impact on climate change. In FY24, we were recognized as an EPEAT Climate+ Champion and an early adopter of the climate change criteria with over 200 registered Climate+ products. A list of product names and gold, silver, or bronze and Climate+ designations are on the EPEAT registry.

**P025_S012**

Supplier emissions energy challenges

---
**P025_S013**

The largest source of emissions often comes from suppliers’ own scope 3 category 1 emissions, but these often take the longest time to reduce. Corporate decarbonization must make economic sense, with priority given to the most straightforward solutions that provide large emissions reduction across all scopes. Reducing scope 2 emissions is often the most straightforward and cost-effective option through renewable energy procurement and energy efficiency projects. However, a primary decarbonization challenge expressed by suppliers is lack of access to renewable energy due to cost and location barriers.

---
**P025_S014**

The IPE also recognized Dell as one of the top three scoring Climate Action Transparency Index (CATI). This score was based on responsive engagement in: supply chain transparency, compliance performance, green supply chain practices, energy conservation and emissions reduction efforts and levels of public disclosures.

Circular design The strategy and evolution of design at Dell

---
**P031_S001**

Since its introduction in FY22, Concept Luna has evolved into an inspiration and guidepost for Dell’s circular design approach. Our design teams gathered a wealth of knowledge and strategies during product prototyping that pushed the boundaries of what Dell’s sustainable technology could look like now and in the future. We continue to implement these findings in our products and further build our portfolio of innovative designs.

---
**P031_S002**

Product design plays a significant role in reducing waste and emissions. Our aim is to keep products and materials in use for as long as possible, so we implement designs that allow our products to be more easily disassembled. This makes them easier to repair, refurbish, reuse and recycle.

---
**P031_S003**

However, we understand that creating a positive impact on the world is not something one company can achieve alone. We engage with others – including our competitors – to drive circularity at scale and maximize impact. Our memberships in influential cross-industry partnerships like the Circular Electronics Partnership (CEP) and NextWave Plastics are examples of this collaboration in action. Hosted by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), CEP brings together leaders from industry, international organizations and civil society. CEP facilitates global collaboration on an industry road map to overcome the barriers to a circular electronics industry. This includes improving product and supply chain circularity, and increasing awareness of the importance of circular electronics.

---
**P031_S004**

In addition to our leadership and memberships, we increased our public advocacy efforts. We participated in stakeholder education on the importance of a more circular economy in the technology sector, including a May 2023 Consumer Technology Association Circular Economy panel and a similar panel at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show. We continue to join efforts across industries towards building a more circular economy, which aims to eliminate waste while keeping resources and materials in use longer.

Circular design principles

---
**P032_S001**

To accelerate the circular economy, we work towards design principles that consider sustainability throughout our process.

---
**P032_S002**

Sourcing sustainable materials draws on recycled, renewable or reduced carbon materials for our product designs. We work diligently to ensure the materials we source minimize our impact on the environment. Examples at Dell include low-emissions aluminum in XPS laptops, recycled aluminum with low-emissions aluminum in Latitude and Precision products and recycled copper in the cables of some power adapters. Designing for parts harvesting or recycling is important to make it easy to recover parts and recycle materials from products that reach the end of their lives. Recycling materials uses less energy than processing virgin raw materials. Examples at Dell include clear labeling, easy separation of parts and material types, unified material grades and recyclable materials and working with recycling partners.

---
**P032_S003**

Designing for reuse and repair makes it easier to access and replace damaged or failed parts to extend product life. Reuse uses less energy than recycling, which further reduces carbon footprints. Examples at Dell include modular designs such as single-access service doors, eliminating the use of glues and creating upgradable or interchangeable parts.

---
**P032_S004**

Dematerializing and optimizing reduces needed materials or the impact of processes required to create products. Using fewer resources upfront preserves natural resources and reduces the carbon footprint of mining and manufacturing. Examples at Dell include designing for fewer internal components, lean manufacturing, passive cooling, paints, on-demand production and customer tools like virtualization.

---
**P032_S005**

Evolving business practices by offering services and adjusting business models helps keep resources in the economy and out of landfills. Examples include as-a-Service (aaS) offerings, cascaded ownership (opportunities to remanufacture and reuse materials repeatedly), takeback programs, on-demand services and technologies to drive system change such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and data analytics.

---
**P032_S006**

Designing for durability creates longer-lasting products, which helps avoid or delay the environmental impact created by building new devices. Examples at Dell include improved water spill resistance, greater tolerance for shock and vibrations, wider range of temperature and humidity tolerances, better battery endurance and greater fault tolerance.

In an open-loop system, materials cross industries or functionality, like plastic recycled from water bottles for use in computers. In a closed-loop system, materials are recycled back into an item similar to the original, like parts from old hard drives used as stock for creating new parts for hard drives. Closed-loop systems are the backbone of a circular economy because they keep materials in use through recycling and reuse. We have closed-loop practices in our supply chain and products that contain closed-loop materials recovered from used technology.

Renewables and reclaimed sourcing

---
**P034_S002**

Using recycled metals, including steel, aluminum and copper, reduces our dependence on mining and processing new materials.

---
**P034_S003**

Our work with renewables helps us reduce our dependence on petroleum-based plastic. Renewable materials can be naturally replenished generation after generation. Renewable does not necessarily mean biodegradable or compostable, but they can be quick-growing. Certification programs through our partners affirm that our renewable sources are replenished. We strive to use renewable materials that are recyclable.

---
**P034_S004**

Our work toward reducing plastic use includes dematerializing, substituting and increasing recycled content in our products. Dematerializing is reducing the amount of material needed when creating a product, often by designing and manufacturing it in a less complex manner. We substitute plastic in products with more sustainable recycled or renewable materials.

---
**P034_S009**

• Recycled and low-emissions aluminum: We continue to expand our use of aluminum produced entirely with hydropower. We lowered our carbon footprint by integrating 50% to 75% aluminum produced using hydropower and/or recycled content in select notebooks. Hydropower reduces the emissions of aluminum material by up to 90% compared to traditionally coal-powered production process.

---
**P034_S010**

We began using ocean-bound plastics in our packaging after rethinking the concept of waste, and how to address the developing demand for recycled plastics within the circular economy. In FY24, we also celebrated the six-year anniversary of founding NextWave Plastics in conjunction with the non-profit Lonely Whale and welcomed the new convening partnership of The Circulate Initiative to advance industry collaboration for healthier oceans. NextWave includes 15 member companies and a global network of ocean-bound plastic suppliers.15 Members work to decrease the volume of plastic litter entering the ocean by capturing it within waterways beforehand.

Multipack is a service offered to customers in select regions where multiple products can be packed into a single box, significantly reducing the amount of packaging materials needed for shipping. Customers that order products in large volumes of select notebooks, desktops and servers can combine several units in a single box. Dell multipack solutions have helped products earn EPEAT Gold certificate and offer the sustainability benefits of waste reduction through fewer packaging materials.

**P036_S011**

• Select notebooks have up to a 34% reduction in packaging material weight, complete elimination of plastics with a 100% recycled and renewable corrugate design. Notebooks are 5 units in a single box for multipack.

---
**P036_S012**

In 2021, four years ahead of schedule, we exceeded our commitment to increase our annual use of ocean-bound plastic tenfold by 2025.

---
**P036_S013**

• Select desktops have up to 64% packaging material weight reduction when compared to single pack use. Desktop quantities per box differ based on form factors, with a range of 3 units in a single box to 8 units in a single box for multipack.

---
**P036_S014**

In FY24, we highlight that over 34,500 kg (76,000 lbs) of ocean-bound plastic were incorporated into new Dell-branded product packaging. By using this waste material, we kept it out of oceans and in the circular economy where it can be recycled.

---
**P036_S015**

• For select servers, up to 98% recycled and renewable content, up to 58% reduction in packaging material weight and up to 2.7x reduction in logistics. Servers are 8 units in a single box for multipack.

**P037_S016**

*In FY23, Dell expanded the scope of this goal to include products received by all channels, rather than products received by Dell-owned channels, within the reporting period. We also refined how we measure the goal, from units to overall weight, as a percentage of total weight of product sold (in metric tons). In previous reports, this metric was calculated as a percentage of units. In this report, we have restated FY22 and FY23 using this new methodology to present a more meaningful view of our progress.

**P043_S007**

Prior to Dell’s partnership, participants managed all their data on paper or in spreadsheets. Local volunteers saw that information was lost or difficult to access precisely when it was needed. Our Dell team in Brazil built and launched Enterprise Space (EnS), a platform where students and volunteer consultants can manage all data and information related to their company. The program borrows from the gamification model, turning consultancy into a journey and allowing customization to mimic different business environments in different countries.

survey to a representative sample of approximately half of our team members. This offers another snapshot of our eNPS and helps us further understand how our team members view leadership and how well we are upholding our Culture Code and People Philosophy.

---
**P053_S002**

Senior leaders across the organization are held accountable to drive progress toward our 2030 representation goals. All leaders are responsible and accountable for inclusive leadership through our Culture Code leadership principles and People Philosophy leader expectations. We work to help our leaders understand their role in activating achievement, balance, connection and diversity and inclusion for their team.

---
**P053_S003**

Accountability requires awareness. We have developed a continuous listening strategy that captures feedback from team members at regular intervals throughout the year. This strategy helps us better understand our culture, potential risks, growth opportunities and areas in which we are already performing well.

---
**P053_S004**

Through our continuous listening strategy and robust governance and oversight for our Culture, Diversity and Inclusion (CD&I) work, we are committed to holding ourselves accountable for upholding Dell’s Culture Code and People Philosophy.

---
**P053_S005**

Our Listening Strategy also includes roundtables and listening sessions, which our leaders host with select groups. Additionally, we distribute automated surveys throughout the lifecycle of a team member’s tenure at Dell, including during the candidate experience, onboarding, entry into leadership roles and voluntary exit from Dell. This lifecycle process helps us understand employee perceptions during key milestones.

---
**P053_S006**

Our CD&I investments extend beyond our workforce and include community involvement, partnerships, councils, coalition sponsorships, memberships and public policy actions. We recognize we must represent and advocate for the change we want to see in the broader industry to be credible and most impactful.

---
**P053_S007**

Each year, we ask our team members to complete our annual employee engagement survey, Tell Dell, which helps us assess the application of our Culture Code and People Philosophy and helps us capture our Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS). Tell Dell also serves as a critical tool for leader accountability, as all eligible leaders receive a report of their team’s results from the Tell Dell survey, which also includes a new Leader Net Promoter Score (LeaderNPS). The LeaderNPS indicates how likely a team would recommend their leader. We recognize leaders with high Tell Dell scores, and HR consultants work to build action plans with any leader who does not meet internal threshold scores. For all leaders, we encourage transparency. We ask all leaders to review their Tell Dell results, recognize areas of strength and opportunity and have conversations with their teams to determine next steps for improvement.

At Dell Technologies we believe people should be equitably compensated for the value they deliver to our customers and stakeholders, no matter their gender, ethnicity or other factor. We routinely review salaries — and make adjustments if needed — to ensure we pay employees consistently when compared to peers and the relevant compensation market.

---
**P053_S011**

Dell has dedicated resources and teams in place to drive its CD&I initiatives. Valuing diversity and inclusion is a critical element of our culture. Dell has been advocating for and championing inclusion for many years, hiring our first Diversity Officer in 2000. Dell’s current Chief People, Culture and Inclusion Officer (CPCIO) leads the CD&I and Talent organizations, reporting to the Chief Human Resources Officer.

---
**P053_S012**

We distribute three other quarterly surveys throughout the year. In addition to Tell Dell, we send out pulse surveys in Q1 and Q3. These pulse surveys are more targeted surveys sent to a smaller sample of our team members. Pulse surveys focus on select topics, helping us better understand results from the Tell Dell census or other topics important to leadership. In FY24, these topics included hybrid workplace and team member perceptions around AI. Additionally, in Q4, we distribute our Tell Dell Check-In

Supply chain responsibility

---
**P058_S001**

Executive Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer Kevin Brown leads Dell’s global supply chain and the Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) assurance program that underpins our approach. The SER assurance program is one of the largest in the technology sector. It proactively recognizes and tackles issues within both Dell-owned factories and those of our suppliers, including final assembly, direct and sub-tier suppliers.17

---
**P058_S002**

Adherence to our Supplier Principles is a condition of doing business with us, and it forms the basis for our social and environmental due diligence programs. We work closely with our suppliers to help them develop the necessary insights and capabilities to meet these requirements. Our collaborative supplier relationships help to ensure our supply chain remains one of the most trusted in the industry.

---
**P058_S003**

As a global company, we engage a vast supplier network that faces complex sustainability challenges. We embrace and address these challenges because they bolster our resilience by helping us learn, adapt and grow. This approach has allowed us to build one of the most dependable and durable supply chains in the industry. Our enduring dedication to sustainability is a key factor in our continued success.

---
**P058_S004**

As a condition of doing business with Dell, we require all partners and suppliers to adhere to Dell’s Supplier Principles, which provide the basis for our SER program.

---
**P058_S005**

It takes hundreds of thousands of people worldwide to make our products. We are committed to partnering with our suppliers to respect human rights for all workers in our supply chain. This includes treating all people with respect and dignity, not tolerating forced labor in any form and consistently providing safe working conditions.

---
**P058_S006**

We prioritize human rights and environmental issues, leveraging our operations experience and collaboration with industry partners to promote responsible manufacturing, diversity and inclusion.

Risk assessments

---
**P059_S002**

Our suppliers demonstrate varying levels of maturity in their own corporate sustainability programs. We work closely with them to drive progress and continuous improvement.

---
**P059_S003**

We share SER performance metrics alongside other key indicators, such as cost and quality, as part of our supplier quarterly business reviews (QBRs). Key executives attend QBRs, help determine future business awards and address progress toward aligned goals.

---
**P059_S004**

Our engagement with suppliers at any tier – including final assembly, direct and sub-tier – begins with an assessment of their social and environmental risks. We conduct rigorous initial risk assessments of suppliers before starting a business relationship, and we refresh those risk levels every year through internal tools and processes.

---
**P059_S005**

We use a four-element approach in our SER audit program. This continuous improvement model is a framework for advancing supplier performance that includes risk assessments, supplier audits, corrective action plans and capability building.

---
**P059_S006**

In FY24, 63% of final assembly, direct and sub-tier suppliers improved their audit scores between audit cycles18, which illustrates the effectiveness of our continuous improvement model.

---
**P059_S007**

Supplier audits

---
**P059_S008**

The Dell audit program is one of the largest in the technology sector, both in the number of audits conducted and reach across the supply chain. It is designed to identify sustainability risks in our supply chain and enable suppliers to both mitigate issues and build their SER capabilities. In addition, we engage our suppliers in targeted assessments and programs to drive more opportunities for improvement.

---
**P059_S009**

Corrective action plans

---
**P059_S010**

When areas of nonconformance with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct are discovered through an audit, our Dell SER specialists work with the supplier to create a corrective action plan (CAP) to resolve the issues within RBA- or Dell-defined timelines, whichever is earliest.

determines conformance with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. In addition, we audit a portion of medium- and low-risk strategic partner suppliers to determine if their risk is rising.

---
**P060_S002**

Audit findings may result in corrective action and the implementation of capability-building elements of the continuous improvement model. In FY24, we saw clear improvement in supplier factory audit performance, with 63% of factories that went through at least their second audit cycle improving their audit scores between cycles. This includes final assembly suppliers (69%), direct suppliers (61%) and sub-tier suppliers (64%). Learn more about our supply chain audit results in the By the Numbers section of this report.

---
**P060_S003**

Our engagement with all tiers of supplier — including final assembly, direct and sub-tier — begins with an assessment of their social and environmental risks. During our onboarding process, and prior to commencing a business relationship with a supplier, we conduct a rigorous initial risk assessment.

---
**P060_S004**

We also monitor SER risk for our Dell factories and suppliers annually. Continuous improvement is important for our operations, as well as those of our suppliers.

---
**P060_S005**

Supplier audits

---
**P060_S006**

In addition, we evaluate suppliers’ sustainability risk levels every year through our internal risk assessment tool and calibrate using a supplier self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) to determine risk level using criteria such as:

---
**P060_S007**

One area in which we made progress is our suppliers’ target audit score attainment rate. Dell sets target audit scores for suppliers — at least 180 out of 200 for final assembly factories and 160 out of 200 for other factory tiers. These target audit scores align to high performance based on the RBA Validated Assessment Program.

---
**P060_S008**

We expect our suppliers to adhere to the RBA Code of Conduct. Audits help monitor suppliers’ compliance with the RBA Code of Conduct and highlight any areas of concern, which in turn helps Dell work with suppliers to improve their performance. In FY24, 365 factories in our supply chain across 17 geographic locations were audited.

---
**P060_S009**

• Geographic location: Considers regional risks around social concerns, such as child labor and forced labor, and environmental risks, such as water quality and air pollution.

---
**P060_S010**

We made significant progress in increasing the rate of suppliers who attained our target audit scores. In FY24, our SER specialists worked closely with suppliers to help identify the root causes of issues and drive improvement. Additionally, we engaged across our procurement organization and directly with suppliers’ senior-level leadership to emphasize our expectations. As a result, 77% of our factories are high performing, meaning they scored at least 180 out of 200 available points for final assembly factories, or 160 out of 200 available points for other factory tiers and had no priority findings.

---
**P060_S011**

Our suppliers are audited by RBA-certified third-party auditors whose audits cover over 40 topics across five areas: labor (including risks of forced labor, child labor and noncompliance with weekly working hour requirements), employee health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems. Auditors review documents, observe work practices and independently interview management and workers19 to assess SER standards implementation according to the RBA Code of Conduct.

---
**P060_S012**

• Commodity: Considers specific risks associated with manufacturing, such as labor intensity, manufacturing processes and paints or chemicals involved in the production of a commodity.

---
**P060_S013**

• Prior responsible manufacturing performance: Includes previous audit results and participation in our capability-building efforts.

---
**P060_S014**

In FY24, auditors conducted confidential feedback interviews with 14,077 workers as part of the audit process. After completion, auditors issued final reports identifying areas of noncompliance with the RBA Code of Conduct. The severity and number of these audit findings, classified as priority, major, minor and risk of noncompliance, impact a supplier’s overall audit score, which ranges from zero to 200.

---
**P060_S015**

• Additional insight: Refers to information obtained by Dell team members during regular and unannounced factory visits or from independent sources, such as regulatory and third-party organizations.

Priority and major findings require prompt resolution. Once the supplier addresses an audit finding, it must be closed by a second successful audit or Dell SER specialists, who validate that the issue has been resolved.

---
**P061_S004**

To proactively address risks, we provide resources to suppliers for knowledge and skills building in areas such as forced labor and health and safety.

---
**P061_S005**

Our efforts to strengthen the sustainability of our supply chain go beyond working directly with our suppliers. We leverage our experience and reputation to collaborate with peers and NGOs to educate suppliers and policymakers in hopes of bringing about more significant change and bettering the lives of those within our supply chain.

---
**P061_S006**

Factory consultations: Our SER specialists work directly with supplier factories to better monitor and reduce risk. Engagements are customized to support long-term improvements.

---
**P061_S007**

In FY24, 281 factories completed corrective actions, with 157 closure audits completed to verify corrective actions. 96% of priority findings were closed at supplier factories in the reporting period. (There was one priority finding at a final assembly factory in FY24 that was closed in FY25. 100% of priority findings at direct supplier factories were closed, and 96% of priority findings at sub-tier factories were closed). 67% of priority and major findings were closed overall at supplier factories (38% at final assembly factories, 67% at direct supplier factories and 68% at sub-tier factories).

**P061_S008**

Dell’s participation in programs like the Mekong Sustainable Manufacturing Alliance (The Alliance) in Southeast Asia illustrates our commitment to collaborative education. The Alliance, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by the Institute for Sustainable Communities (ISC) in partnership with ELEVATE and the Asian Institute for Technology (AIT), aims to improve local, domestic and foreign migrant workers’ livelihoods, health and well-being and respect for workers’ rights; foster sustainable economic growth; and achieve greater development commitment and investment of suppliers towards the advancement of their workforces in the Mekong region. This initiative positively impacts workers, local communities and the environment while improving the capacity of factories and increasing their market competitiveness. We are now utilizing key learnings from this partnership to benefit suppliers in additional locations.

---
**P061_S013**

• Coordinating with procurement, including SER representatives and executives, to ensure immediate closure of critical labor findings.

---
**P061_S014**

To support our suppliers as they prepare for RBA audits, we developed an online question-and-answer system to provide quick and accurate answers to common SER management questions. The system was created in collaboration with internal and external experts, making it accessible to companies of any size or level of sustainability management experience.

---
**P061_S015**

• Requiring suppliers to build internal audit and governance mechanisms to prevent future instances if critical labor audit findings occur.

**P062_S004**

Dell is a member of the Responsible Labor Initiative and actively collaborates with stakeholders to address forced labor. We abide by the RBA Code of Conduct, which prohibits our suppliers from charging recruitment fees to their workers, even in locations where these practices are legal. By requiring suppliers to address fee payment issues when they occur and reinforcing responsible employment and recruitment practices through our SER specialists, we continue to drive improvement in this area.

---
**P062_S005**

Dell adheres to industry standards required by the RBA Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct limits factory line workers to a maximum of 60 working hours per week or the limit stipulated by local law (whichever is stricter) and requires that employees and contractors have a minimum of one rest day per week.

---
**P062_S006**

Consistently meeting this standard is an ongoing challenge across manufacturing and is affected by several factors, including but not limited to fluctuations in customer demand, workers’ desire to work voluntary overtime, transportation challenges and continuing global supply chain issues.

---
**P062_S007**

Dell does not tolerate forced labor of any kind. Dell prohibits our suppliers from charging recruitment fees to their workers, employs robust due diligence efforts and actively collaborates with stakeholders to address the risk of forced labor.

---
**P062_S008**

Breaches of working hour limits are the most common audit findings among supplier factories in our industry.20

---
**P062_S009**

Dell SER specialists work with our suppliers to identify and resolve challenges to meeting working hour limits. For example, a supplier faced an RBA audit violation for excessive working hours. Our SER specialists worked with the supplier to address this violation by improving management practices, establishing a sustainable production rhythm and exploring automation and employee retention strategies. As a result, this supplier successfully reduced working hours and met compliance standards.

---
**P062_S010**

Although overtime is voluntary, excessive working hours impact work-life balance and, in some cases, increase health and safety risks. This is an important area of focus for us, and we are committed to working with our suppliers to improve overall compliance with the industry standard.

---
**P062_S011**

Due diligence efforts include conducting confidential interviews with supplier management and, separately, with workers as part of regular audits. We also take immediate action to investigate any allegations related to recruitment fees received through our helpline, media sources or NGO reports.

---
**P062_S012**

Our strategy with suppliers includes the following actions:

---
**P062_S013**

• Weekly monitoring of factories with known risks of nonconformance based on past audit performance. This provides an early indicator of potential deviation from the standard.

If we learn that a supplier is not following recruitment fee practices as required by the RBA Code of Conduct, we:

---
**P062_S015**

In FY24, our tracking of suppliers meeting the standard for weekly working hours covered 187,046 workers at 128 supplier factories. The vast majority of these workers — 88.2% — worked 60 hours per week or less. Additionally, 83.1% of these workers took at least one rest day per week, every week in FY24, up from 81.7% in FY23.

Responsible minerals sourcing

---
**P065_S001**

Tracking conformance rates

---
**P065_S002**

These commitments are underscored in the Dell Responsible Sourcing Policy. We also coordinate with industry-wide groups such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). A Dell sustainability leader sits on the RMI steering committee to further our commitments and actively drive progress. RMI, and organizations like it, promotes a common approach, tools and processes supporting sourcing decisions that drive improved and consistent overall regulatory compliance.

---
**P065_S003**

To track conformance rates, we require suppliers who use 3TG within their supply chain to complete the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template. To extend our due diligence process, we have engaged with the RMI to use the Extended Minerals Reporting Template for suppliers using cobalt or mica.

---
**P065_S004**

Minerals are an important component of many Dell Technologies products. Some of these minerals are potentially mined in conflict-affected and high-risk areas. While we do not purchase minerals directly from mines, smelters or refiners, our expectations for responsible sourcing extend throughout our supply chain. It is our goal to purchase materials containing minerals whose mining and sale are aligned with our responsible sourcing commitments.

---
**P065_S005**

Because the sourcing of minerals is an ever-changing landscape, we are committed to watching this space closely to protect the lives and health of the people in our supply chain.

---
**P065_S006**

Our responsible sourcing efforts focus on key “conflict minerals” (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold — known as 3TG) and follow the recommendations established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance. These include conducting risk assessments, assurance and transparent reporting. We also track other minerals of concern, including cobalt, used in lithium-ion batteries, and mica, used as an electrical insulator.

---
**P065_S007**

Given the many supply chain tiers involved and the size of smelting and refining operations, multiple suppliers will likely include some of the same SORs in their reporting. Through the RMI, Dell encourages suppliers to promote SOR participation in third-party assurance programs to achieve conformance or remove them from their supply chains. More information is available in our Conflict Minerals Disclosure.

---
**P065_S008**

Our approach places an emphasis on identifying and assuring smelters or refiners (SORs) used to process material supplied by mines or mineral processors. This includes an independent, third-party assessment of management systems and sourcing practices to validate conformance with the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). The sector-wide RMAP standards meet the OECD Due Diligence Guidance requirements, the Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the European Parliament and the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Dell annually files a Conflict Minerals Disclosure with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

One essential measurement of our success is how much we spend with small and diverse businesses. In CY23, Dell spent more than $3 billion21 with small and diverse businesses, showing our continued commitment to working with these suppliers. For the 14th consecutive year, Dell also earned recognition through the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR), which celebrates corporations that spend at least $1 billion annually with minority- and women-owned businesses.

---
**P066_S003**

One element of our supplier diversity initiatives is the support of skills development for small and diverse suppliers. To provide these suppliers with the most effective tools, we partner with third parties who specialize in relevant skills development. We also support our suppliers through one-on-one mentoring to build their capabilities.

This commitment to security and resiliency is core to meeting our 2030 goal of becoming the most trusted technology partner for customers and partners.

---
**P068_S007**

Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no user, device or application is automatically trusted, even if it is inside the organization’s network.

Ethics governance

---
**P072_S002**

Our expectations for third parties are clearly set in our Code of Conduct for Partners and Supplier Principles. For our go-to-market partners, we take an extra step to ensure Dell products and services are purchased with integrity and transparency. We also work with industry experts to provide our partners with digital tools to assess and improve their own anti-corruption programs. We leverage business intelligence to continuously audit and monitor our direct partners to ensure adherence to our expectations. Partners who are found to violate our ethics standards are disciplined and held accountable.

---
**P072_S003**

Our Code of Conduct helps team members translate Dell’s values into actions and provides guidance on how we carry out our daily activities across the company in accordance with our culture and in compliance with the letter and spirit of all applicable laws in the countries in which we work.

---
**P072_S004**

During FY24, we named a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) to oversee Dell’s Global Ethics and Compliance Office. The CECO plays a broader risk and governance role as co-chair of the Global Risk and Compliance Council (GRCC) and Enterprise Risk Steering Committee (ERSC). To ensure independence in decision making and authority, the CECO reports dotted line to the chair of the Audit Committee and provides quarterly readouts to the full committee.

**P072_S005**

Ethics is foundational to all we do at Dell Technologies. By adhering to the highest ethical standards, we build trust with our customers, team members and stakeholders. We create a positive reputation that will contribute to our success for decades to come, proudly leading in this space and continuously striving to enhance our programs. We believe our culture and values are differentiators. For the 12th year, Dell has been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies® .

---
**P072_S006**

Our culture and values reflect what is most important to us as a company and guide our decisions and actions:

---
**P072_S007**

• Customers: We believe our customer relationships are the ultimate differentiator and the foundation for our success.

---
**P072_S008**

• Winning Together: We believe in and value our people. We perform better, are smarter and have more fun working as a team than as individuals.

---
**P072_S009**

One of the ways that Dell maintains an ethical culture is by expeditiously and thoroughly investigating allegations of misconduct made against team members or partners.

---
**P072_S010**

• Innovation: We believe our ability to innovate and cultivate breakthrough thinking is an engine for growth, success and progress.

---
**P072_S011**

Speak Up is our reporting system that augments our other efforts to foster a culture of trust, integrity and ethical decision making. Speak Up allows our Global Ethics and Compliance Office line of sight into attempted circumvention of policies and/or controls or other activities that may negatively impact customers and other stakeholders. Anyone can confidentially and anonymously use Speak Up to report suspected violations of the Dell Technologies Code of Conduct, policies or applicable laws. Dell does not tolerate retaliation and is committed to protecting team members who report suspected misconduct in good faith.

Principles for ethical artificial intelligence

---
**P073_S002**

We are committed to winning business only on the merits and integrity of our products, services and people. Corruption damages our company and the communities where we do business. Dell takes a zero-tolerance stance on bribery both within Dell and for our go-to-market partners who represent the Dell name. This zero-tolerance policy is outlined in our internal Global Anti-Corruption Policy. Our team members and go-to-market partners receive frequent communications and trainings on our anti-corruption policy.

---
**P073_S003**

We believe artificial intelligence (AI) must be developed and applied ethically and responsibly. In FY23, we established the Dell Technologies Principles for Ethical Artificial Intelligence, a set of guiding principles to follow as we develop and use AI applications. We also established the AI Review Board, which reviews all internal use cases for AI and ensures adherence to laws and to our principles for AI.

---
**P073_S004**

In FY24, we named our first-ever Chief AI officer and created the AI Center of Innovation and Excellence whose responsibility is to enable Dell to reach its full AI potential through people, process and tools. This includes helping set governance, policies and managing risks in addition to working with our learning and development teams to establish a pan-Dell AI curriculum that ensures our team members have the required AI skillsets.

Consistent with adhering to the highest ethical standards, we continue to invest in our Trade Compliance Program, driving compliance with global sanctions, export controls and import requirements. We are committed to doing business with customers, vendors and other partners who share our commitment to equality, trust and driving human progress.

---
**P073_S007**

We are leveraging AI and applying these principles internally to improve our own processes. In FY24, we expanded upon our Corruption and Risk Detection System (CARDS) and filed a U.S. patent application. CARDS is a machine learning-enabled software application designed to proactively detect potential risks in the quoting pre-sales workstream.

---
**P073_S008**

We leverage tools such as customer and vendor screening and other procedures to ensure that we do not sell to or purchase from unauthorized entities. As global restrictions continue to increase in complexity, we continue to proactively strengthen our program through enhanced cross-functional collaboration, improved tools and awareness initiatives across the business.

• Reducing duplication of efforts and creating a consistent approach across different departments and business units, leading to increased efficiency and cost-savings.

---
**P075_S004**

Dell Technologies believes that effectively assessing and managing risk is central to the design and execution of our business strategy and the creation of long-term value. Our Board of Directors, directly and through its standing committees, oversees the establishment and maintenance of our governance, compliance and risk oversight processes and procedures to promote the conduct of our business with the highest standards of responsibility, ethics and integrity.

---
**P075_S005**

Our governance framework incorporates ESG targets and goals into the company’s overall strategy and operations. We have established governance bodies, including the ESG Steering Committee and ESG Interlock Team, tasked with overseeing and executing our Sustainability and ESG strategies and progress. We have evolved the responsibilities of these governance bodies to meet emerging trends and our growing ESG efforts.

• Improving our reporting and transparency by ensuring that ESG data is collected, analyzed and reported consistently and accurately, enhancing our transparency and credibility with stakeholders.

---
**P075_S009**

To ensure an integrated perspective and approach to ESG, these management committees are composed of members from various teams across the company, including representatives from functions such as corporate sustainability and ESG, diversity and inclusion, human resources, philanthropy, security, ethics and privacy, supply chain audit, corporate affairs, government affairs, internal audit, legal, risk management, investor relations, accounting, finance, and product, operations and services teams.

---
**P075_S010**

One of the board’s many strengths stems from the diversity of perspectives and understanding that arises from convening individuals of varied backgrounds and experiences. We currently have two members on our eight-member board who identify as women and one director who identifies as Black/African American, and we will continue to ensure a diverse pool of candidates is considered for each seat. Six of our board members are classified as independent, according to New York Stock Exchange guidelines.

---
**P075_S011**

Representatives from our ESG Steering Committee regularly provide the Board of Directors with updates on progress against our ESG goals and initiatives to support the integration of ESG measures with the company’s overall business strategy. In addition to these regular updates, we provide relevant training to the board as needed. For example, in FY24, the board received training on the company’s corporate human rights policy commitments, due diligence and governance practices in alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

---
**P075_S012**

Together, these governance bodies develop, manage and measure ESG strategy and performance. Our ESG governance framework ensures a central point of control, communication and decision-making, strengthening our ability to add long-term value, minimize risk and drive societal progress by:

management risk committees are an integral part of the overall ERM structure, promoting risk management and compliance best practices and oversight within the business.

---
**P077_S003**

Dell’s Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight, and Dell’s management is responsible for designing processes and procedures to identify, assess and manage risk on a day-to-day basis. Management has implemented an enterprise risk management (ERM) program, managed by Dell’s internal audit function and supported by management risk committees. The ERM program is designed to work across the business to identify, assess, govern and manage the Company’s strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks. Our ERM program seeks to enhance enterprise awareness of risk management, recommend best practices for risk management and highlight critical risk areas to optimize allocation of resources.

---
**P077_S004**

The output of the Company’s enterprise risk assessment serves as an important consideration in the Company’s risk based internal audit roadmap. Regular updates are provided to the Board and Audit Committee on various risk-related matters as identified by the ERM program, including any related to climate risks.

Although Dell continually assesses its risk environment, the internal audit function performs an annual risk assessment that is informed by risk data collection, an analysis of industry trends, consideration of insights of third-party risk reporting companies, peer benchmarking and interviews with senior leaders and Company experts. The annual assessment considers whether risks constitute short, medium and long-term threats to our enterprise and provides for prioritization, in part, based on the timeframe of such risks. Our ERM program is assessed externally on a periodic basis for best practices and maturity of the program. The ERM program aims to identify the most critical risks and opportunities impacting Dell’s business objectives.

• A deep-dive scenario analysis on three key topics: covering a physical risk in our supply chain, a transition risk in carbon pricing and a transition opportunity around low-carbon products. Scenarios included those by the IPCC and IEA between 1.5C and 4C+, with time horizons from 2030 and 2050. This analysis helped us refine our mitigation planning for financial value that is at risk across our supply chain, for potential impacts that carbon pricing could have on our supply chain and for changes in the price of goods and services that we purchase.

---
**P078_S002**

We are committed to identifying, managing and mitigating climate risks by leveraging our ERM program alongside ESG and climate-specific governance models. We use the framework proposed by the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) to ensure that climate risks are governed to the same standard as other risks we face, while acknowledging the unique long-term nature of climate change.

---
**P078_S003**

We assess ESG-related risks to ensure we understand our potential risk areas. Our materiality assessment helps us understand ESG-specific topics most material to our business, and we will have a clearer understanding of ESG topics most material to Dell at the conclusion of our in-progress double materiality assessment. For topics such as human rights and climate risks, we conduct assessments with third-party experts to better understand our risks.

---
**P078_S004**

In FY24, we conducted a climate-specific risk assessment using scenario analysis. The analysis incorporated the latest climate scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their sixth assessment and covered physical risks, transition risks and climate opportunities.

| Sustainable materials (continued) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Percentage of product content made from recycled, renewable or reduced carbon emissions material | % | 5.9% | 10.8% | 14.1% | The scope includes all Dell Technologies-branded products shipped within the reporting period. The measurement is based on the estimated amount of recycled and renewable materials as a percentage of total weight of materials used. In FY23 we expanded our goal to include reduced carbon emissions material (see the Appendix of this report), and the change is reflected within the reported metrics beginning in FY24. This metric is used to track progress toward our goal: By 2030, more than half of our product content will be made from recycled, renewable or reduced carbon emissions material. |
| Ocean-bound plastic used in products | kg | --- | 111,432 | 170,376 |  |
| Percentage of recycled/ renewable material content in packaging | % | 90.2% | 94.5% | 96.4%** | The scope includes packaging of all Dell Technologies-branded materials sent to customers. The measurement is based on survey responses from packaging suppliers across multiple lines of business, used to determine approximate percentages of total weight of recycled, renewable or reusable materials in our packaging. In FY23, we expanded our goal to include where we utilize reused packaging — original packaging that has been recollected and reused. However, measurement and reporting capabilities for reused packaging are still in development and we now expect to reflect the expanded scope of this goal in future reports. We continued pioneering sustainable packaging through innovative renewable material designs, waste reduction efforts like multipack, and easy recyclability for customers. We advanced to 96.4% recycled or renewable materials in our packaging, an increase from 94.5% in FY23. This metric is used to track progress toward our goal: By 2030, 100% of our packaging will be made from recycled or renewable material, or will utilize reused packaging. |
| Ocean-bound plastic used in packaging | kg | 103,235 | 68,317 | 34,548 | Utilization of ocean-bound plastic in packaging has declined, which is aligned with our primary focus of phasing out plastics from our packaging. We continue to explore innovative, sustainable alternatives to plastics. |
| Responsible electronics disposition |  |  |  |  |  |
| Percentage of product collected | % | 20.9% | 27.3% | 30.1% | The scope of this goal includes products received by Dell-owned channels within the reporting period. In FY23, we expanded the scope of this goal to include products received by all channels, rather than products received by Dell-owned channels, within the reporting period. We further refined how we measure the goal, from units to overall weight, as a percentage of total weight of product sold (in metric tons) in FY23. In FY24, Dell improved its product recovery rate to 30.1%, a 2.8 percentage point (pp) increase from the previous year. Dell initiatives for enabling responsible e-waste disposal and promoting a circular economy for technology products contributed to this change.† This metric is used to track progress toward our goal: By 2030, for every metric ton of our products a customer buys, one metric ton will be reused or recycled. |

90.2% 94.5% 96.4%** The scope includes packaging of all Dell Technologies-branded materials sent to customers. The measurement is based on survey responses from packaging suppliers across multiple lines of business, used to determine approximate percentages of total weight of recycled, renewable or reusable materials in our packaging. In FY23, we expanded our goal to include where we utilize reused packaging — original packaging that has been recollected and reused. However, measurement and reporting capabilities for reused packaging are still in development and we now expect to reflect the expanded scope of this goal in future reports.

---
**P084_S008**

We continued pioneering sustainable packaging through innovative renewable material designs, waste reduction efforts like multipack, and easy recyclability for customers. We advanced to 96.4% recycled or renewable materials in our packaging, an increase from 94.5% in FY23.

| Performance metric* | Unit of measure | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 | Notes |

| Digital inclusion |  |  |  |  |  |
| Total number of people reached | Number of people (cumulative measurement beginning FY20, direct + indirect reach) | 159,742,242 | 289,298,127** | 396,186,264 | Approximately 396 million people have benefited from our digital inclusion programs, partnerships and innovation in total since FY20, including 107 million in FY24 alone. By partnering with schools, governments, nonprofits and private organizations, we are creating an ecosystem committed to driving digital inclusion by creating opportunities for underrepresented communities around the world. The scope includes the total number of individuals reached directly or indirectly through Dell programs such as regional giving and social innovation (e.g., Digital LifeCare). Due to the vast geographical spread of data and limited capacity of partners to verify data at the granularity of each beneficiary, our direct and indirect impact metrics are not a unique representation of lives impacted. In FY24, we refined our methodology, tracking unique representation for our direct impact. Indirect impact is not tracked uniquely due to the nature of the community outreach, and this practice is in line with common measurement and evaluation practices across the industry. Impact measurement and reporting is evolving and maturing at a rapid pace. To ensure Dell’s measurement methodology aligns with latest industry best practices, Dell will undergo third party analysis on the 1 billion lives goal methodology in FY25. The analysis and adjustments as a result of the analysis will be shared and reflected in our FY25 ESG report. This metric is used to track progress toward our goal: By 2030, we will improve 1 billion lives through digital inclusion. |
| Percentage of people reached directly who identify as girls and women, or underrepresented groups | % (cumulative measurement beginning FY20, direct reach only) | 54.1% | 49.0% | 51.5% | Of the people reached directly through Dell programs such as regional giving and social innovation in FY24, 51.5% identify as girls and women, or underrepresented groups, a 5.0% increase from FY23. Our efforts focused on providing equitable access to technology, skills development, and community support tailored to the needs of these underserved populations. Percentage of individuals who voluntarily identify as girls, women or members of underrepresented groups within the total number of individuals reached as reported in the “1 Billion Lives” goal. “Girls” and “women” are individuals who self–identify as female. The term underrepresented includes but is not limited to the following groups: girls or women, racial/ethnic minorities, beneficiaries requiring an accommodation (mental, physical, sensory, cognitive and neurodiverse disability), LGBTQ+ persons, low socioeconomic groups. This metric is used to track progress toward a key driver that supports our goal: By 2030, we will improve 1 billion lives through digital inclusion. |
| Total number of future-ready skills training hours at in-house manufacturing locations | Hours of training | 13,045 | 13,296 | 12,522 | In FY24, Dell-badged team members completed 12,522 hours of future-ready skills training at our in-house manufacturing locations. This program provides professional and personal skill-building opportunities to help build digital skills and essential skills for frontline workers, line leaders and engineers. This metric is used to track progress toward a key driver that supports our goal: By 2030, we will improve 1 billion lives through digital inclusion. |
| Total number of future-ready skills training hours in supply chain |  | 144,658 | 112,541 | 118,956 | In FY24, Dell recorded 118,956 hours of future-ready skills training at supplier sites through our pilot program.

Our progress on this goal decreased from 52% in FY23. We attribute this year’s decline in employee giving and volunteering to organizational change. This metric is used to track progress toward our goal: By 2030, 75% of our team members will participate in giving or volunteerism in their communities. |

Through our Pro Bono program we offered consulting, skills training and technology solutions to help nonprofits leverage digital tools and better serve their communities. Currently, this measurement covers the number of nonprofit organizations that have participated in a Pro Bono program. We are developing measurements to include nonprofits that are supported through other Dell efforts, including direct business unit giving and those organizations that benefit from organic, skill-based employee volunteering. Dell has invested in the development of a Digital Assessment Tool that is now available to nonprofits globally. This tool enables nonprofits to measure and determine their current digital capacity, identify digital transformation priorities and recommended resources and track their progress against those priorities over time. The Digital Assessment Tool was developed by TechSoup, a third-party provider. This metric is used to track progress toward a key driver that supports our goal: By 2030, 75% of our team members will participate in giving or volunteerism in their communities. |

in reporting numerical values. Historically, rounding conventions and decimal place consistency have varied throughout our reports. Moving forward, it will be standard practice to present uniform, comparable and specific data whenever possible. This will provide stakeholders with more detailed and reliable information. While this objective is newly instituted this year, we anticipate full alignment within two additional reporting cycles.

---
**P101_S003**

We commissioned an external third party to perform limited assurance on FY24 metrics for:

---
**P101_S004**

In FY23 we expanded the scope of one of our 2030 Circular Economy goals to reuse or recycle one metric ton for every metric ton of our products a customer buys to include products received by all channels, rather than only products received by Dell-owned channels, within the reporting period. We further refined how we measure the goal, from units to overall weight, as a percentage of total weight of products shipped, which better aligns with industry standards, and more accurately represents the collections volumes. In this report, we have restated FY22 and FY23 using this new methodology to present a more meaningful view of our progress.

• Percentage of recycled/renewable material content in packaging

---
**P101_S011**

• Representation metrics tied to our Inclusive Workforce goals*

---
**P101_S012**

The total number of people reached toward our goal to improve 1 billion lives through digital inclusion by 2030 was underreported for FY23. Although the discrepancy in the total was relatively small, considering the cumulative nature of this metric, we restated the number in order to avoid creating a misleading impression of our progress in FY24 by attributing more than actually achieved within the reporting period.

| Material topic | Goal | Metric | Methodology |

| Advancing sustainability |  |  |  |
| Climate action | By 2050, we will achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3 | MT COe of scope 1, scope 2 and 2 scope 3 (reported categories) GHG emissions | We focus on reducing direct and indirect emissions in areas with the largest opportunity for impact. Our goal is aligned with the SBTi definition of net zero, inclusive of 90% reduction and 10% abatement, and we submitted our net zero goal for SBTi validation in FY24.

|  | Key Driver: By 2030, we will reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products by 30% | MT COe of scope 3 category 11 2 GHG emissions | Calculations for this key driver are done through a two-step process. First, we calculate the aggregate energy footprint for each product type. For client, displays, networking and server products, this calculation is based on the lifetime expected energy use for representative models and the number of units shipped by country during the reporting period for each of these models. For storage products, this calculation is based on the expected lifetime energy use for the representative drives and enclosures shipped during the fiscal year. Second, we calculate country- specific carbon footprints using International Energy Agency (IEA) published emissions factors. We adjust the IEA emissions factors to account for the updates to Global Warming Potential factor differences between Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fourth and Sixth Assessment Reports (AR4 and AR6). We sum the country-specific carbon footprints to estimate a worldwide scope 3 category 11 figure for Dell’s hardware portfolio. The country-level emissions factors for purchased electricity change regularly. For FY24, this calculation uses the 2022 estimated emissions factors published by the IEA in 2023. Where those are not available, we use the IEA’s 2021 figures that were also published in 2023. |

| Advancing sustainability |  |  |  |
| Circular economy | By 2030, more than half of our product content will be made from recycled, renewable or reduced carbon emissions material | Percentage by weight of recycled, renewable and reduced carbon emissions content in shipped products | The scope includes of all Dell Technologies-branded products shipped within the reporting period. The measurement is based on the estimated amount of recycled and renewable materials as a percentage of total weight of materials used. In FY23 we expanded our goal to include reduced carbon emissions material (see the Glossary of this report), and the change is reflected within the reported metrics beginning in FY24. |
|  | By 2030, 100% of our packaging will be made from recycled or renewable material, or will utilize reused packaging | Percentage of recycled, renewable or reused material content in packaging | The scope includes packaging of all Dell Technologies-branded materials sent to customers. The measurement is based on survey responses from packaging suppliers across multiple lines of business, used to determine approximate percentages of total weight of recycled, renewable or reusable materials in our packaging. In FY23, we expanded our goal to include where we utilize reused packaging — original packaging that has been recollected and reused. However, measurement and reporting capabilities for reused packaging are still in development and we now expect to reflect the expanded scope of this goal in future reports. |
|  | By 2030, for every metric ton of our products a customer buys, one metric ton will be reused or recycled | Percentage of product collected (percentage by weight of total captured for recycling and reuse over products sold) | The scope of this goal includes products received by Dell-owned channels within the reporting period. In FY23, we expanded the scope of this goal to include products received by all channels, rather than products received by Dell-owned channels, within the reporting period. We further refined how we measure the goal, from units to overall weight, as a percentage of total weight of product sold (in metric tons) in FY23. |
| Transforming lives |  |  |  |
| Digital inclusion | By 2030, we will improve 1 billion lives through digital inclusion | Total number of people reached (cumulative measurement beginning FY20, direct + indirect reach) | The scope includes the total number of individuals reached directly or indirectly through Dell programs such as regional giving and social innovation (e.g., Digital LifeCare). Due to the vast geographical spread of data and limited capacity of partners to verify data at the granularity of each beneficiary, our direct and indirect impact metrics are not a unique representation of lives impacted. In FY24, we refined our methodology, tracking unique representation for our direct impact. Indirect impact is not tracked uniquely due to the nature of the community outreach, and this practice is in line with common measurement and evaluation practices across the industry. Impact measurement and reporting is evolving and maturing at a rapid pace. To ensure Dell’s measurement methodology aligns with latest industry best practices, Dell will undergo third party analysis on the 1 billion lives goal methodology in FY25. The analysis and adjustments as a result of the analysis will be shared and reflected in our FY25 ESG report. |
|  | Key Driver: Each year through 2030, 50% of the total people directly reached will be those who identify as girls and women, or underrepresented groups | Percentage of people reached directly who identify as girls and women, or underrepresented groups (direct reach only) | This metric captures the percentage of those who identify as girls, women or underrepresented groups out of the total number of individuals directly reached within the reporting year. “Girls” and “women” are individuals who self-identify as female. The term “underrepresented” includes but is not limited to the following groups: girls or women, racial/ethnic minorities, beneficiaries requiring an accommodation (mental, physical, sensory, cognitive and neurodiverse disability), LGBTQ+ persons, low socioeconomic groups. To ensure our methodology aligns with industry best practices, we will be undertaking third-party analysis on our 1 Billion Lives goal methodology in FY25 - inclusive of this key driver. We expect any adjustments as a result of the analysis will be reflected in future reports. |
|  | Key Driver: Each year through 2030, we will deliver future-ready skills development for workers in our supply chain | Total number of future-ready skills training hours at in-house manufacturing locations | The scope is the total future-ready skills training data for all in-house manufacturing locations in our pilot program. |
